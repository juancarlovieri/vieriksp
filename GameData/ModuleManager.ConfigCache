Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

This has earned them a reputation for being a friendly, reliable partner, which means they have good standings with many other companies. In the aerospace circles, it is considered very poor manners to be rude about WinterOwl or its products.

These traits however, have made Zaltonic indispensable in their own way, as they are willing to take on the manufacturing of the less exciting devices, and they've become quite good at doing that in a quick and cost-effective way. Their products might not be all the rage, but when your fancy remote guidance unit runs out of juice, chances are you'll be using a Zaltonics battery to keep it powered.

			#autoLOC_307865 = Today we will tackle an absolutely essential skill for any Space Program: Getting to Orbit. Without this skill we might as well be teaching you Kerbal Flight Simulator.I trust you've already checked the other Flight tutorials, as well as the Advanced Construction one to be familiar with the "Kerbal 1" vessel we will be launching today.If not, I highly recommend you do so before going through this one.If you want to go back and try the others, then press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> and choose <color=<<3>>>End Scenario</color>. Otherwise press <color=<<4>>>Next</color> and we'll proceed.
			#autoLOC_307866 = Next
			#autoLOC_307880 = Flight Plan
			#autoLOC_307889 = Alrighty then, let's do it. As I said before, the plan here is to get our vessel (and pilot) safely into orbit.As with the suborbital flight we did previously, we will follow a curved path to get to the point where we can "circularize" our orbit. Today's "gravity turn", however, will be much shallower than the path we followed previously so that we build speed towards orbit.This is different from how the Kerbal pilots of old did it, they would head straight up and then hang a right as if the air was soup or something. We'll be turning early and smoothly, but don't turn too far or you might be mistaken for one of those low-flying turkeys...As with the previous flight, I will place a target marker on the navball to show you the optimal velocity vector. But do note that this indicator won't be around normally, and is not usually used the way this tutorial uses it. I'll also display some technical information about your path as you go, to help you learn the right way to get there.For now to set your throttle to the max (Press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>) and prepare to launch!
			#autoLOC_307890 = Next
			#autoLOC_307907 = Ready to Launch
			#autoLOC_307924 = You should now see the marker on the navball, so you'll have something to follow, and this ship has been designed so that you don't need to worry about throttle control during the ascent.Hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> when you are ready to "Go for Orbit".If you want Valentina (the Kerbal pilot) to fly the curve for you, then you can enable S.A.S. and set the mode to <color=<<3>>>Target</color> after liftoff.
			#autoLOC_307936 = On Your Way
			#autoLOC_307943 = Don't worry about your throttle. You just need to pay attention to the target marker, and the proper times to stage. I'll prompt you along the way.Get ready to start pitching down once you reach 60m/s!
			#autoLOC_307959 = Start Pitching
			#autoLOC_307968 = Time to start pitching down! Follow that target marker.Don't worry about your throttle. You just need to pay attention to the target marker and the proper times to stage. I'll prompt you along the way.
			#autoLOC_307984 = Get Ready to Stage
			#autoLOC_307991 = We are almost of our fuel in the SRBs, so get ready to eject them by staging.You will need to press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> when its time.
			#autoLOC_308007 = Stage Away Boosters
			#autoLOC_308014 = Stage now to discard those empty SRBs.Hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> now!
			#autoLOC_308030 = SRBs Away
			#autoLOC_308041 = You're doing great. Keep following the target indicator, and get ready to stage again to discard the lower stage.
			#autoLOC_308057 = Staging Again
			#autoLOC_308064 = Stage now to get rid of the exhausted lower parts.Hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>!
			#autoLOC_308080 = Lower Stage Away
			#autoLOC_308091 = Stage again to ignite the Upper stage engine.
			#autoLOC_308107 = Upper Stage Lit - Go To Map
			#autoLOC_308114 = Excellent. You've survived through the first phase of the launch and now we have a longer, more gentle burn to accelerate towards apoapsis.If you switch to map mode (press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>) we can have a look at the trajectory of the rocket and watch the apoapsis rise as we gain speed.
			#autoLOC_308130 = Map View
			#autoLOC_308139 = While you are here, we do need to keep the vessel following the target indicator or we may not reach orbit. Don't forget that failure IS always an option.Press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to bring up the navball and we can discuss your trajectoryI'll keep altitude and apoapsis displays open so you can track your progress.
			#autoLOC_308142 = Altitude: <<1>>mApoapsis: <<2>>m
			#autoLOC_308162 = NavBall
			#autoLOC_308169 = Great. Now you can keep an eye on that trajectory while we track our future path.If you hover over the apoapsis (Ap) node on the map, you will be able to see the estimated highest altitude on our future path. You can <color=<<1>>>right-click</color> on that marker to pin it  so that it remains visible even when you move your mouse away.We need to keep burning along that path until we will clear the atmosphere by a handy margin. We'll aim for 80km.Cut the engine (press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color>) once the apoapsis hits 80km; I'll cut it for you once it passes 81km. Meanwhile I'll keep an altitude display open so you can track your progress ascending, and an apoapsis display to track your progress reaching an 80km Ap.
			#autoLOC_308172 = Altitude: <<1>>mApoapsis: <<2>>m
			#autoLOC_308193 = Coasting Along
			#autoLOC_308212 = And that's going to get us there. I've made sure the engine is shut off now and we'll coast till we clear the atmosphere at 70km altitude.You may notice your speed dropping a little as we coast. That's nothing to be concerned about; it's just gravity trying to bring us down and air trying to prevent our success. We'll beat it though! You're looking good.Meanwhile I'll keep an altitude display open so you can track your progress ascending to your apoapsis.Altitude: <<1>>mApoapsis: <<2>>m
			#autoLOC_308226 = Warping Ahead
			#autoLOC_308241 = Now that we are clear of the atmosphere, we can warp ahead through time to get to the apoapsis more quickly. Important rocket scientists like us do not have time to waste!Press <color=<<1>>>Next</color> when you're ready and we'll warp till it's time to make our next burn.
			#autoLOC_308242 = Next
			#autoLOC_308271 = Orient Your Vessel
			#autoLOC_308288 = We're almost there. Now all we need to do is accelerate some more so that we fall past Kerbin. That's basically what an orbit is: falling and missing. Gravity will be pulling us towards the center of Kerbin, but we'll be travelling so fast that we constantly miss.Rotate your craft to align it with the prograde marker (We'll learn more about that later), or use S.A.S.'s <color=<<1>>>Manuever</color> mode. When it's time to throttle up, I'll tell you.
			#autoLOC_308302 = Circularize
			#autoLOC_308311 = Now throttle up!I'll cut your engines once you've completed the burn I've calculated for you, or you can yourself once you're in a stable orbit.
			#autoLOC_308312 = Next
			#autoLOC_308340 = In Orbit
			#autoLOC_308362 = Congratulations! You are now officially in orbit. That is quite the achievement!Hopefully you can see the difference between the suborbital hop and this reaching orbit ascent, and just how far (and early) we turned.Also, notice how we designed our rocket to accelerate reasonably through the ascent, and didn't go straight to "Ludicrous" speed. Over-powering the ship is a common rookie mistake.
			#autoLOC_308363 = Next
			#autoLOC_308378 = Summary
			#autoLOC_308387 = That's as far as I will be taking you today. We can catch up again in the Orbit 101 tutorial where I will show you about orbits and adjusting them.If you want to fly solo for a bit you can also try bringing Valentina home from this tutorial flight. You will need to turn around 180 degrees and burn retrograde until your periapsis is less than 20km, at which height the atmosphere will do most of the braking for you. Stage away the upper stage when you hit the atmosphere's edge, orient retrograde, and re-enter like I taught you in the flight basics tutorial.Or simply choose <color=<<1>>>End Scenario</color> from the <color=<<2>>>Pause</color> menu and I'll see you later.
			#autoLOC_308388 = Finish
			#autoLOC_308406 = Internal View
			#autoLOC_308418 = Aha!, You're a curious one arent' you? The IVA button over each crewmember's portrait will let you see the ship from his own perspective.Note that in this mode, your flight UI has less instruments, since most of them can be found in the cockpit itself.In Internal View, right-clicking will toggle between mouse-look and interact modes, so you can look aroud without having to hold down the right mouse button. Try looking around and clicking on things, the Engineering department says there are many devices in here that actually work. They seemed to be quite proud of that, in fact.When there are multiple crew you can cycle through the POV of them using the [<<1>>] key.Return to External View by pressing [<<2>>].
			#autoLOC_308438 = Failure
			#autoLOC_308451 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here, you might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission. Don't feel bad, I'll send someone to clean that up and you can try again another time.
			#autoLOC_308452 = Finish
			#autoLOC_308470 = Docking Control Mode
			#autoLOC_308481 = I see you've found the Docking Controls. In this mode, controls behave somewhat differently, to make maneuvering around in orbit easier. However, that is a topic for a whole other tutorial, so let's just go back to the subject at hand for now.Press the Staging button on the bottom-left corner to return to the Staging Control Mode.
			#autoLOC_308501 = Off Course
			#autoLOC_308512 = Aw, shucks, something went wrong here\u2014you're way off course. You need to be quick about following the instructions. If you're having trouble controlling your vessel set it to S.A.S. follow target mode as I explained and let S.A.S. fly it for you; you'll just have to worry about staging. Once you've seen how it should be flown, then you can try flying on manual. Don't feel bad, it takes lots of practice!If you still have propellant left, you can try reaching orbit on your own. Or you can try aborting and landing safely\u2014always a good skill to practice. Otherwise please restart the tutorial.

			#autoLOC_308648 = Asteroid Redirect Mission, Part 1
			#autoLOC_308656 = Asteroids. Awesome to look at and great to have around; not so much when one lands on your house. Today we're going to learn how to keep that from happening.As anyone who has played Galaxy Intruders for more than ten minutes can tell you, it's not about firing at where they are, but about aiming at where they're going to be.
			#autoLOC_308657 = Next
			#autoLOC_308667 = Rendezvous
			#autoLOC_308674 = For that, we're going to walk through a process called "rendezvous." It's really, REALLY helpful for making spaceships meet out there in space, and eventually dock, so pay attention.The idea is to know how fast something is going and where it's headed so you can be at the same place at the same time in order to meet it.Now open your map view to take a look at some things.
			#autoLOC_308682 = Asteroids
			#autoLOC_308689 = Through luck, divine intervention or some well conceived tutorial writing, this particular asteroid here has been captured in an eccentric but stable Kerbin orbit.This is about as lucky as one can get with these bodies, because in reality most of them will just zoom past Kerbin or take a single trip around it before leaving, never to return.When choosing your own target asteroid, I recommend you see what there is to choose from through the tracking station and designate one of your liking to be permanently tracked. (If you don't track it, catching it will be just about impossible.)
			#autoLOC_308690 = Next
			#autoLOC_308701 = Rendezvous - Theory
			#autoLOC_308708 = First things first\u2014Basic orbital mechanics. If you match your orbit to an object's precisely, you'll be moving at the same speed as it is.Because of the way orbits work, if you're closer to the body you're orbiting than the object you are trying to meet, you will be going faster than it is\u2014and you'll be going slower than it is if you're orbiting higher.
			#autoLOC_308709 = Next
			#autoLOC_308719 = Rendezvous - Practice
			#autoLOC_308728 = Knowing this, let's get started. You know the usual drill from previous tutorials: tweak that maneuver node on your orbit to plot an intercept that gets as close as possible to the asteroid. I've already targeted it for you, but if you deselect it, target it again.Actually, I'm sure if you fine-tune it thoroughly\u2014moving it and tweaking the burn amounts\u2014you can get very close.I recommend using your mousewheel when the mouse pointer is over the node modifiers to make fine adjustments, instead of click-dragging on their handles as we did before, but use whichever method gives you finer control.You can check how close your encounter will be if you mouse over the color-matched pairs of closest-approach indicators.
			#autoLOC_308731 = This is what the intersect icons look like.
			#autoLOC_308733 = Next
			#autoLOC_308743 = Rendezvous - Precision
			#autoLOC_308751 = When you're happy with your plotted maneuver, execute the burn.One final word of warning though: when executing this kind of precision maneuver, try to leave as little deltaV remaining as possible or the end result could vary greatly from what you had planned.We will not proceed until the intercept is within tolerances needed for this tutorial\u2014if you don't get it after one maneuver, plot and execute another one a bit further ahead and so on until your final intercept separation is less than 100 kilometers.
			#autoLOC_308769 = Rendezvous - Fine Tune
			#autoLOC_308776 = Good job. You're now on an orbit similar to but lower than the asteroid's. Keep it targeted and experiment with your maneuver nodes until you have a closest-approach distance of less than 10 kilometers, then execute the burn and wait for that encounter.This step is actually optional. Just keep in mind that the closer your orbit takes you, the less fuel you'll have to use.Anyway, when you're done click <color=<<1>>>Next</color>.
			#autoLOC_308777 = Next
			#autoLOC_308787 = Rendezvous - Approach
			#autoLOC_308794 = And this is where speed and efficiency are key. Wait until you're about 5 minutes away from your encounter.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> the velocity meter in your navball until it is in target mode and so displays your relative velocity to your target. You're moving at roughly the same speed, but even a small difference will cause you to drift apart.Turn the ship target-retrograde and use your boosters or RCS thrusters to lower that velocity to 0.0 m/s. That means that relative to the asteroid, you are no longer moving. Note that after such a long wait, your batteries could be depleted and your ship unresponsive. Not a problem. Just get out of map view and deploy your solar panels to start charging the batteries and supplying power to the ship.And if you do leave the map screen, you can probably get a visual sighting of the target asteroid by this time in the approach.
			#autoLOC_308795 = Next
			#autoLOC_308811 = Rendezvous - Almost There!
			#autoLOC_308819 = Ok, so now you are "not moving" and you're so close to the asteroid you can almost touch it. What you have to do now is aim yourself towards the asteroid by pointing at the pink round icon in your navball, since it points toward the target's location. Burn a little to get closer and turn yourself retrograde to kill your speed again. For small adjustments you can also use RCS translation burns (<color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>, <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>, <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color>, <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color>, <color=<<9>>>[<<10>>]</color> and <color=<<11>>>[<<12>>]</color> keys) to tweak your approach.Repeat these steps as needed.
			#autoLOC_308820 = Next
			#autoLOC_308840 = Rendezvous - Complete
			#autoLOC_308848 = And here we are at the target. Now all that's left is to grab that rock, but we'll leave that for next time, since your head is probably about to explode with new information already.So for now, just suffice it to say that you achieved quite a feat. Goodbye for now.
			#autoLOC_308849 = Finish
			#autoLOC_308860 = Failure
			#autoLOC_308868 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here. You might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission, you know...Don't feel bad, you can always try again.
			#autoLOC_308869 = Finish
			#autoLOC_308884 = Died
			#autoLOC_308926 = Asteroid Redirect Mission, Part 2
			#autoLOC_308937 = Well pilot, you caught up to the target asteroid, but don't pat yourself on the back yet. You're not even close to done. How about we catch this rock?<color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> on the <color=<<2>>>"The Klaw"</color>, the grasping device (a white dome) at the top of your ship, and arm it from the part's action menu.
			#autoLOC_308938 = Next
			#autoLOC_308944 = Disabled
			#autoLOC_308955 = The Grappling Device
			#autoLOC_308962 = This modern marvel of technology will grab onto anything that it touches. The boys at the lab had an intern hanging from there for a whole day. Thing didn't even budge.The equipment has limits, though, so don't expect to catch any asteroids by ramming it into them at full speed. It would be like stepping on a soda can, but one that's worth a lot of taxpayer money.
			#autoLOC_308963 = Next
			#autoLOC_308974 = The Grappling Device
			#autoLOC_308981 = And that's why we're going to handle the claw with care. Now, with your grapple armed, target the asteroid (If you haven't already) and slowly and carefully use your RCS thrusters to move towards the asteroid.Once you're close enough, and if the angle of the surface is not overly steep, the mechanism will activate on its own and grab this load of valuable and amazing minerals for us. Be patient; this will take some time, but if you rush it and miss you will make matters worse.If you fail to activate the grapple on the first try, you do have enough RCS propellant to back away and try again.
			#autoLOC_308995 = Efficiency
			#autoLOC_309002 = There you go. Now we've grabbed onto the asteroid.You can pretty much call it yours now, but to make things more official, you should rename it. <color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> it and choose <color=<<2>>>Rename Asteroid</color> to do so. There's something important when it comes to moving asteroids; efficiency. If you think the way you're grabbing the asteroid doesn't matter, I'd ask you to get up, grab a bag of groceries and carry it around with your arm fully outstretched at a 90 degree angle from your body. Then do the same carrying the bag close as you normally would and tell me if that took the same effort.<color=<<3>>>Right-click</color> the asteroid again and choose <color=<<4>>>Target Center of Mass</color> to help you align things in the next step.
			#autoLOC_309003 = Next
			#autoLOC_309013 = Pivot and Alignment
			#autoLOC_309024 = Your grapple and the thrust of the ship must obey the same principles. That's why we have a pivot to modify your connection angle and to make aligning to your centre of mass a complete breeze.<color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> on the grapple and choose <color=<<2>>>Free Pivot</color>. The grapple itself will remain connected to the asteroid, but you will be able to independently move your ship and realign it.What you're trying to set up here is aiming the nose of the ship so that it points at the asteroid's center of mass. If you can do that, the asteroid will not wobble around or try to drag your ship to the side while the engine is firing. Obviously, that will make it easier for the ship to push the asteroid where you want it to go. Go ahead and adjust yourself until you have a better alignment, then lock the pivot again.
			#autoLOC_309025 = Next
			#autoLOC_309035 = Redirect Start
			#autoLOC_309042 = Now you're all set to start redirecting your asteroid. Whether you want to use it to study materials, make it a mass destruction weapon by dropping on a world, or create a rocky space station like some pesky mutant, you're going to have to move your pet rock.
			#autoLOC_309043 = Next
			#autoLOC_309053 = Rendezvous - Approach
			#autoLOC_309060 = While you could start setting up maneuver nodes and burning in order to move that heavy load of yours right now, it would come at a great fuel cost, so it's better to plan a more efficient approach.Open your map, set Kerbin as your target, and find the point where Kerbin's orbit is closest to yours, then set up a maneuver node OPPOSITE to that, on the far side of your orbital path. This is when you will be at your lowest velocity, making it that much easier to adjust your orbit.
			#autoLOC_309061 = Next
			#autoLOC_309076 = Rendezvous - Almost there!
			#autoLOC_309084 = Now try creating a maneuver which will get you back under Kerbin's SOI. Sounds simple enough, but watch out for two things.First of all, you're carrying a LOT of mass, so before calling it done, see if the maneuver is achievable. Rule of thumb is, if you're getting more than a 10 minutes estimated burn time, you will probably run out of fuel before completing it.Secondly, if it seems like it's impossible getting a return course, right click the maneuver node. Along with a delete button, two more buttons will appear. These alter the calculation of the burn's results to see what would happen if it was made not on this orbit, but the one after that, or the one after that. So if you don't get it in this lap, maybe you will in the next one, or in 100 years (we might be late for tea.)
			#autoLOC_309085 = Next
			#autoLOC_309137 = Rendezvous - Practice
			#autoLOC_309146 = That flight plan looks okay, but it seems like you will have to wait for a loooooong time, so I'll leave you to it.My last advice about this is to use all of your piloting skills when actually executing the burn, sometimes it's hard to keep your ship steady when it weights tens of tons. And also, patience, I know this is a long mission, but you must endure, or use time warp, whatever suits you best.That's all for my part, see you on Kerbin.
			#autoLOC_309147 = Finish
			#autoLOC_309158 = Failure
			#autoLOC_309166 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here. You might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission, you know...Don't feel bad, you can always try again.
			#autoLOC_309167 = Finish
			#autoLOC_309362 = Docking
			#autoLOC_309369 = Hello, today we'll be going over a very exciting process: making two separate ships attach so they can share resources, crew, or simply become a bigger ship. If you're interested in orbiter-lander missions or creating space stations, this will be a must, so pay attention.Let's begin.
			#autoLOC_309370 = Next
			#autoLOC_309381 = Coplanar Orbits
			#autoLOC_309388 = In order to dock to another ship, the first thing you have to do is catch up to it. "Rendezvous" with it, to use the technical lingo. To accomplish that, the first thing you have to do is put your ship in a coplanar orbit, meaning an orbit with the exact same inclination.Open your map (<color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key) to see the scenario at hand.
			#autoLOC_309397 = Coplanar Orbits
			#autoLOC_309404 = Look at those poor guys! They're doomed to orbit Kerbin forever, unless you go to their rescue, which you should, because our space program's reputation will go down if we leave people marooned out in space. If you play around with the camera, you will notice that your orbit and theirs don't have the same inclination. That means that if the ships ever did pass close to each other, they would do so at dangerously high speed and just zip on past each other on different paths. In this situation, the first thing we need to do is align our orbit with that of the other ship.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the ship named "Stranded" and set it as your target.
			#autoLOC_309412 = Ascending and Descending Nodes
			#autoLOC_309419 = Good. Now you will notice a few new things have appeared on your orbit. Green ascending and descending node indicators now show the points where the plane of your orbit crosses the plane of the target orbit, and white dotted lines connect these points to your own orbit line.
			#autoLOC_309422 = This is what these nodes look like.
			#autoLOC_309424 = Next
			#autoLOC_309435 = Ascending and Descending Nodes
			#autoLOC_309444 = We want to have your orbit coincide with that of the target, so let's start that job at one of the points where the paths already cross. Go ahead and add a maneuver node at the nearest of the two nodes (probably the ascending node) and manipulate the normal direction handles so that your inclination with respect to the target orbit is zero. You can mouse over the AN/DN line as it moves around the orbit to know the estimated inclination after the burn. If you can't seem to get exactly zero,  try moving the maneuver node itself a bit.Execute the burn when you're ready.
			#autoLOC_309445 = Next
			#autoLOC_309463 = Transfer Orbit
			#autoLOC_309470 = Outstanding! Now your orbit and the stranded ship's are coplanar.The next step is to generate a transfer orbit, much like you do when you're targeting another celestial body, which will transfer your ship from one orbit to the other. Create a maneuver node on your orbit (it doesn't really matter where since we're going to move it around anyway), and then extend the prograde vector until you get an intersecting orbit. Some of the other new indicators in target mode are the orange pair and pink pair of closest approach markers. Play with the prograde and the node position until you get the matching colored pair of these intersection nodes close to each other: ideally within a 5km range.
			#autoLOC_309473 = This is what the intersect icons look like.
			#autoLOC_309475 = Next
			#autoLOC_309493 = Transfer Orbit
			#autoLOC_309500 = That looks nice. Now, execute that planned maneuver as precisely as possible. You will most likely not get it exactly as the maneuver node predicts. For better precision, I recommend you burn at full throttle until the delta-V counter on the node is down to about 10m/s, and then cut your engine. Then make a few short, low-throttle burns to fine-tune the intercept.
			#autoLOC_309501 = Next
			#autoLOC_309521 = Enroute to Rendezvous
			#autoLOC_309528 = Good! Now you're in a trajectory that will get you very close to your target. If you think you can get even closer, I suggest fine-tuning the encounter using your RCS thrusters instead of the main engine. However, no matter how close you get, you'll still be going too fast to actually do anything about it unless we do one more thing. And that is to step on the brakes at the right time.That is of course just a figure of speech because there's no such thing as a brake pedal in spacecraft. For now, let's wait until we're about 15km away from the target. Once there, make sure that the navball is in "Target" mode so that the proper indicators will be displayed during the critical final maneuvers. If it isn't, click the velocimeter a few times until it is. While in target mode, turn toward the retrograde marker and burn at full throttle until your relative velocity drops below 50m/s.
			#autoLOC_309529 = Next
			#autoLOC_309545 = Rendezvous - Full Stop
			#autoLOC_309553 = Okay, you are now pretty close to the target ship and you're moving slowly with respect to it, but we have to come to a full stop or we'll drift away.First of all, leave map view now because you are close enough for the main display to be not just useful, but advantageous. Watch until you're about 5 km away from the target. Point your ship towards retrograde again, then press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to turn on your RCS thrusters, and finally press and hold <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> until your speed drops to zero.If RCS is taking too long, you can throttle up slightly, but just briefly or you'll over-burn!Oh, and one more thing: always remember to turn off your RCS thrusters when you're not using them, so their attempts to help you hold attitude do not accidentally push you off course.
			#autoLOC_309554 = Next
			#autoLOC_309570 = Rendezvous - Almost There!
			#autoLOC_309578 = Now we're not moving with respect to the target. Good. All that's left to do is to approach carefully.This time point your ship towards the target and thrust forward using your RCS. In this step, don't let your speed go beyond 10 m/s to make sure that you will be able to stop in time to prevent a collision. If you start drifting away, brake to a stop again and start the approach once more. Once you're closer than 100 meters we'll proceed.
			#autoLOC_309582 = This is what the Target icon looks like.
			#autoLOC_309596 = Rendezvous - Almost There!
			#autoLOC_309605 = BRAKE! NOW! Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Now is a good time to deploy your docking port. <color=<<2>>>Right click</color> it and press the <color=<<3>>>Open Shield</color> button. Also, now that you're this close it's time to make a little adjustment. Right now you're targeting the whole ship, but we can get more precise than that. <color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> the target ship's docking port and set it as target. Note how the distance changed: the target port is used as the position for your indicators now. Also, <color=<<2>>>right-click</color> your own port and click the <color=<<3>>>Control from Here</color> button. Now the indicators are measuring themselves from one docking port to the other which will make this much easier.Once that's all done, approach the target ship again, very slowly: the idea is to get both docking ports to line up and just barely touch.
			#autoLOC_309606 = Next
			#autoLOC_309617 = Alignment
			#autoLOC_309626 = In order to get the docking ports to touch each other, you need to align your docking port to the other ship's. This basically means that you want your prograde vector and the target vector to overlap on the navball. There are a few measures which can help with that.- You can change the camera mode with <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to find one of your liking, I recommend the chase mode for this task.- Apart from staging mode, your HUD also has a docking mode, so press the docking mode button under the staging display on the lower left of the screen. What this does is change to an alternate control scheme, from rotation to translation, so that your <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>, <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color>, <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color>, <color=<<9>>>[<<10>>]</color> keys will control translation and <color=<<11>>>[<<12>>]</color> and <color=<<13>>>[<<14>>]</color> are up and down. It's a bit like controlling a Kerbal in EVA flight.- Using docking mode isn't strictly necessary, since you can use the <color=<<15>>>[<<16>>]</color>, <color=<<17>>>[<<18>>]</color>, <color=<<19>>>[<<20>>]</color>, <color=<<21>>>[<<22>>]</color>, <color=<<23>>>[<<24>>]</color> and <color=<<25>>>[<<26>>]</color> keys to translate in the normal staging mode as well. Use whichever mode works best for you. If you get confused, you can <color=<<27>>>View Key Bindings</color> at any time in the Pause menu.
			#autoLOC_309627 = Next
			#autoLOC_309638 = Docking - Conclusion
			#autoLOC_309647 = However you decide to do it, the point is you have to get both docking ports aligned as closely as possible. Once they're about a Kerbal's height apart, you will see their built-in magnetic assist kick in, and they will attract each other to an actual dock.To get a better view, you might want to press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> multiple times to get Locked mode so your controls align with your view, or even go to internal view with <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>.I'll leave you to do that. If an attempt doesn't go well, back away about a ship's length (to reset the magnetic assist) and try again. Outside of these tutorials, you can also use the quicksave and quickload feature <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color> and <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color> keys to back up time for additional attempts. Keep in mind that this feature is not available in all difficulty settings, though.
			#autoLOC_309671 = Docking - End
			#autoLOC_309679 = Well done! Let me tell you, you just did one of the hardest things there is to do with spacecraft. Congrats!Now, to conclude your rescue mission successfully you have two options. you can transfer fuel to the stranded ship, undock and leave them to their fate, I don't recommend it, but if you want to do that press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> + right click on the fuel tanks you'll be transferring to and from.The other option is to transfer the crew to your ship, undock (right click the docking port to get this menu option), and take a road trip back to Kerbin. To move personnel, click on the stranded ship's capsule door and select the Kerbal(s) to transfer, one at a time, then select your own ship's pod. The cabin below the decoupler won't be surviving the return trip, it's below the decoupler!Each option has benefits and drawbacks. Let me know which one you chose when you're back on solid ground.
			#autoLOC_309680 = Finish
			#autoLOC_309691 = Failure
			#autoLOC_309699 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here. You might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission, you know...Don't feel bad, you can always try again.
			#autoLOC_309700 = Finish
			#autoLOC_310122 = Basic Construction
			#autoLOC_310129 = Welcome to today's lecture on vessel construction. I'm Wernher von Kerman.Whether you want to put a satellite into orbit, make a transcontinental flight, or step onto the very surface of the Mun, you're going to need to build yourself a ship.It should be pretty easy even if you're not a famous rocket scientist like myself.
			#autoLOC_310130 = Next
			#autoLOC_310141 = Overview
			#autoLOC_310149 = In this tutorial, I will first show you around the Kerbal Space Center, then take you to the Vehicle Assembly Building, where you'll learn how to construct a simple ship.We'll cover adding and removing parts, what the parts do, how to change the performance settings of the parts which have that option, and how to control staging.At the end of the tutorial you will have a craft fit for a quick hop from the launchpad.At each step I will lock out all controls other than the ones you need for that step. If you still manage to mess up (it took even me some time to become as skilled as I am now!), you can press the <color=<<1>>>Back</color> button to go back and fix things. (It won't light up unless you do mess up.)
			#autoLOC_310150 = Next
			#autoLOC_310160 = Kerbal Space Center
			#autoLOC_310168 = We are now at the Kerbal Space Center. I'll give you a quick rundown on how to get around.The KSC, for short, is home to the pinnacle of Kerbal endeavour and achievements for space exploration. Using the facilities you can see here, you will be able to manage your space program, create rockets and planes, track your Kerbal explorers as they roam the solar system, find exciting new uses for explosive substances, and in case of emergency, hire more Kerbals.To find out about each of the facilities, you can hover your mouse over them or the facilities buttons (they show up when the cursor is outside this window). If you need to repair a structure (or upgrade them in career), you can do this by right-clicking them.Take some time to hover the mouse over the buildings and see what they each are, and when you're ready enter the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB).
			#autoLOC_310181 = Inside the VAB
			#autoLOC_310206 = Very good! What you see in the middle of this screen is the construction area. This is where parts are placed and your craft is constructed.On the left side of the screen is the Parts Toolbox. It will show all the parts you have available in each of the different categories, once there are any to pick, that is!
			#autoLOC_310207 = Next
			#autoLOC_310218 = Select a Command Module
			#autoLOC_310243 = If you want your craft to be controllable you need a command module, and it's best to make it the first part you place.This part will either contain some plucky Kerbal crew or an automated pilot mechanism.As we're just starting there's only one choice. Go ahead and pick that command module from the <color=<<1>>>Pods</color> tab.
			#autoLOC_310254 = Looking Around
			#autoLOC_310279 = After at least one part is placed, you can look around with the following controls. Orbit the camera:  <color=<<1>>>[Arrow Keys]</color> or  <color=<<2>>>Right Mouse Drag</color> Move the camera up/down:  <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> / <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color> or  <color=<<7>>><<8>></color> Zoom the camera:  <color=<<9>>>[<<10>>]</color> / <color=<<11>>>[<<12>>]</color> or  <color=<<13>>>[Shift]</color> + <color=<<14>>><<15>></color>
			#autoLOC_310280 = Back
			#autoLOC_310289 = Next
			#autoLOC_310307 = Adding a Parachute
			#autoLOC_310327 = If you'd like your pilot to be able to make more than one flight, he or she will have to return safely to the ground (or water) on Kerbin. Parachutes are a simple way to make sure that happens. They can be found on the <color=<<1>>>Utility</color> tab (change tabs by clicking their icons on the left of the part list window).When you're choosing parts you can view the details of available parts by hovering over them in the toolbox. When the info is visible, most parts have an additional information window which can be opened with a right-click. Note that the parachute states the effective diameter in each state and what the maximum safe speed for deployment is.Go ahead and select the <color=<<2>>>Mk16 Parachute</color> by <color=<<3>>>left-clicking</color> on it. Then move it to the top of the command pod so that the green sphere at the bottom of the parachute lines up with the green sphere at the top of the pod. <color=<<4>>>Click</color> again to attach.
			#autoLOC_310328 = Back
			#autoLOC_310337 = Next
			#autoLOC_310356 = Adjusting Part Options
			#autoLOC_310376 = Some parts, like our parachute here, have configurable options. To see these we need to <color=<<1>>>right-click</color> on the parachute we just attached to the pod. Do that now and you will see the available parameters.On the parachute you will see that we can adjust our altitude and the atmospheric pressure at which to open; that setting can be quite useful on distant worlds.For now let's check that the opening height on the chute is at least 1000m, because safety is the Kerbal way, after all. For the min pressure slider, move it a bit to the right, to 0.2. This setting prevents the chute from activating until the atmosepheric pressure is above the configured value - on Kerbin 0.2 is about 9 kilometers in altitude, so even if you stage early and arm the parachute, it will wait until then to activate.You can hide these options by right-clicking on the background scene or picking up another part (when there's one available). When you're happy with that we can proceed.
			#autoLOC_310377 = Back
			#autoLOC_310392 = Next
			#autoLOC_310414 = Add a Solid Motor
			#autoLOC_310434 = Next up, we are going to need something to make us go.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the <color=<<2>>>Engines</color> tab on the left to show the available engines and solid rocket motors.Grab one and connect it to the bottom of the pod. You may need to zoom or move the camera to be able to do so.
			#autoLOC_310435 = Back
			#autoLOC_310446 = Next
			#autoLOC_310465 = Oops!
			#autoLOC_310482 = Oops! I forgot you're just starting out. You're not a famous rocket scientist, and to make that craft survivable as it stands now you'd have to be better at rocket science than me. Hah, impossible!The problem with that craft is that this solid rocket is too powerful for the payload (a single small pod and chute). It will either burn up on ascent from going too fast, or burn up coming back down. Even if you survive that, the craft's mass will cause it to fall too fast for the parachute to operate properly, and you'd hit the surface before it could stop you!Ok, I promise to teach you how to change that to make it work in a later tutorial, but for now let's continue.Well, at least this way I get to tell you about removing parts. Pick up the <color=<<1>>>BACC "Thumper"</color>, and either drop it back over the Parts Toolbox or press <color=<<2>>>[Delete]</color>.
			#autoLOC_310483 = Back
			#autoLOC_310494 = Next
			#autoLOC_310513 = The Right Solid Motor
			#autoLOC_310530 = Instead, let's add the solid motor that's a better match for a ship of this size.At the start of your career you will have what I consider rubbish parts. Literally: the motor here looks like, and may well be, a converted trash can.That said, it does have enough oomph to get this little craft moving skyward, and quickly. As you progress you will be able to unlock more engines and other parts.For now though, let's pick up the <color=<<1>>>RT-5 "Flea"</color> and connect it to the bottom of the pod.
			#autoLOC_310531 = Back
			#autoLOC_310542 = Next
			#autoLOC_310561 = The Staging Stack
			#autoLOC_310582 = Nice one. You've built the simplest survivable craft possible. We could go launch this right now, but it might be safer to explain one other thing first.
			#autoLOC_310585 = In the bottom right you will see the staging stack - it's the box with the number 0 and icons for the parachute and engine in it. This stack shows us which parts will be activated as we "stage" our rocket.
			#autoLOC_310587 = What this shows is that when we activate the next stage both the engine and the parachute will be triggered. While it could be considered funny to open the chute and fire the motor at the same time, it's not going to give you much of a flight.To fix this we need to separate the engine and chute into two stages. If you mouse over the "0" stage you will see a little + and - appear to the left of the box. <color=<<1>>>Click</color> the <color=<<2>>>plus</color> button to add a new stage. If you add too many, click the minus button on the extra ones to remove them. Make sure you have precisely two stages.
			#autoLOC_310588 = Back
			#autoLOC_310603 = Next
			#autoLOC_310617 = Adjusting the Staging Stack
			#autoLOC_310625 = Excellent. It's important to note that the stages activate from the highest number and then count down. So our first stage will be stage 1 (the engine) and our second one will be stage 0 (the chute). Now <color=<<1>>>drag</color> the engine icon from stage 0 down to stage 1 to give our pilot some comfort.
			#autoLOC_310626 = Back
			#autoLOC_310640 = Next
			#autoLOC_310672 = Saving it for Later
			#autoLOC_310686 = That's it. We now have a safe - well, relatively safe craft that's ready to go. Let's make sure that if we need this design again we don't have to build it all from scratch.At the top of the screen you will see the name for our craft. Hmm. "untitled space craft" doesn't seem so majestic. Why don't you change that to be something more your style, and you can add a description if you'd like to?When you use the load screens later, these names and descriptions help you to grab the right vessel.When you're happy with the name, <color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the <color=<<2>>>Save</color> icon in the upper right.
			#autoLOC_310687 = Next
			#autoLOC_310701 = Summing Up
			#autoLOC_310726 = Excellent work. Feel free to play around with the parts and techniques I've shown you, and when you're ready to continue, press the red button in the upper right to exit.Back at the Training menu, try the Flight Basics tutorial to learn how to fly this little craft, and then the Intermediate Construction tutorial can teach you more about the editor.<color=<<1>>>NOTE:Any vessels you create here will be lost when you exit, this is just for playing around.</color>
			#autoLOC_310727 = Done
			#autoLOC_312688 = Advanced Construction
			#autoLOC_312696 = Welcome to the third and final tutorial about construction \u2014 the Advanced Construction tutorial!I've had to delay some important work today to fit this in, so pay close attention as I show you how a real rocket scientist makes orbital craft.Go on! Go inside the VAB.
			#autoLOC_312709 = Overview
			#autoLOC_312730 = In our last tutorial we built a vessel that could escape the atmosphere, but it didn't have enough oomph to escape for long.This time around, we'll cover more advanced rocket design concepts like multiple stages and boosters, as well as the extra parts like RCS and solar panels. You'll want these if you spend more than a few minutes in orbit.When we're done you'll have a craft capable of ascent to orbit, orbital operations, and a safe return to Kerbin \u2014 and you can test it out in the Go For Orbit tutorial, which will teach you how to make use of it all.
			#autoLOC_312731 = Next
			#autoLOC_312744 = Getting Started
			#autoLOC_312752 = You'll notice that there are lots more parts available this time. That's because an orbit-capable craft is much more complex than that little puddle jumper I showed you how to make last time.However, the main principles are the same, so I hope you remember what I taught you.If you mess up and, say, somehow manage to delete your whole craft, you can hit <color=<<1>>><<2>></color> + <color=<<3>>>[Z]</color> to undo your last change.
			#autoLOC_312753 = Next
			#autoLOC_312766 = Select the Pod
			#autoLOC_312777 = Again, you only have one pod available, so go ahead and select it.If you select the wrong part, click on it in the main view to pick it up, and either drop it back over the Parts Toolbox or press <color=<<1>>>[Delete]</color>, then try again.
			#autoLOC_312778 = Next
			#autoLOC_312794 = Add the Chute
			#autoLOC_312803 = Just like last time, select a parachute and place it.
			#autoLOC_312804 = Next
			#autoLOC_312820 = Adjust Parameters
			#autoLOC_312828 = And again like last time, adjust the parachute parameters by right-clicking on the part you just placed.When the chutes Min Pressure is 0.75 and you're satisfied, click <color=<<1>>>Next</color>.
			#autoLOC_312829 = Next
			#autoLOC_312845 = The Upper Stage
			#autoLOC_312855 = We're now going to construct an upper stage.This upper stage will finish placing the pod in orbit and, once there, provide RCS steering thrusters and electricity for the pod. It will also provide all manuevering capability in orbit, including the reentry burn.It's going to consist of a decoupler (we don't want to carry it home), an RCS fuel tank, a Liquid Fuel tank, 4 RCS thrusters, 4 solar panels, 4 batteries, and an efficient upper-stage engine.That's quite the shopping list, isn't it? So let me know when you're ready to proceed.
			#autoLOC_312856 = Next
			#autoLOC_312869 = Add a Stack Decoupler
			#autoLOC_312879 = Firstly, we will add a stack decoupler below the pod to let us discard the parts we don't want to bring back with us.Grab a decoupler from the Toolbox and attach it to the bottom of the pod, paying close attention so that its little red arrows, as we discussed before, point up, to make sure that the decoupler is oriented the right way. If the arrows are pointing down, that's not good. Detach it from the pod, then use <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>, <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>, <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color> and <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color> to rotate it to be the right way up, and then reattach it.
			#autoLOC_312880 = Next
			#autoLOC_312896 = Add an RCS Tank
			#autoLOC_312904 = Next we'll add an RCS tank. RCS stands for Reaction Control System, and this fuel will help us with fine maneuvers.Go to the <color=<<1>>>Tanks</color> category and add an <color=<<2>>>FL-R25 RCS Fuel Tank</color> under the decoupler.
			#autoLOC_312905 = Next
			#autoLOC_312921 = Tweak RCS Loading
			#autoLOC_312929 = Your craft is not going to need all the MonoPropellant in the tank, so to save some weight, <color=<<1>>>right-click</color> it to get to the part's options and move the slider down to 96 units.Monopropellant is called that because, while large rocket engines use two propellants (fuel and oxidizer), RCS uses a single propellant.RCS is generally less efficient, but is good for small velocity changes in any direction (rather than just forwards like the main engines do), and can be used to rotate the craft as well as move it.
			#autoLOC_312930 = Next
			#autoLOC_312946 = Add Propellant Tanks
			#autoLOC_312954 = We'll be adding multiple Liquid Fuel tanks in this stage to get the right amount for the upper stage engine, and we need an extra tank to offset the weight of the RCS.So add a tiny rocket propellant tank (it's the one named <color=<<1>>>FL-T100 Fuel Tank</color>), and then add a medium one (<color=<<2>>>FL-T400 Fuel Tank</color>) below it.
			#autoLOC_312955 = Next
			#autoLOC_312971 = Add a Terrier Engine
			#autoLOC_312979 = Lastly for the main parts of this upper stage, we'll add an engine. The "Terrier" engine produces almost no thrust at sea level air pressure, but is highly efficient in space (and above 20km, where the atmosphere is thin enough to not interfere with the exhaust). This makes it a good choice for an upper stage, since the engine will not be activated until the rocket has reached the conditions where this kind of engine works well. If you select the wrong engine, you can always throw it away and try again.Add an <color=<<1>>>LV-909 "Terrier"</color> to the bottom of the tank.
			#autoLOC_312980 = Next
			#autoLOC_312996 = Show Center of Mass
			#autoLOC_313006 = Nicely done! That's a pretty well assembled upper stage, if I do say so myself. It'll get you to orbit if you put enough rocket under it. While we have this reasonably simple vessel here, let's explore one of the other useful tools we have available.To make sure that your ship flies controllably, some parts need to be placed carefully around a point inside the ship called "the center of mass." This CoM is a spot where the mass on one side is balanced by the mass on the other side. Thrust applied through the CoM will cause the ship to move without unwanted rotation, while thrust (properly) applied around the CoM will cause the ship to rotate without moving.This makes the CoM such a useful and important thing that we added a tool so the assembly building can show it to you with a marker. Let's have a look at how that indicator works here.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the CoM indicator toggle and we'll have a play. Here's a picture of it, with the indicator highlighted.
			#autoLOC_313010 = Next
			#autoLOC_313026 = Watch the CoM
			#autoLOC_313036 = OK, lets adjust the fuel levels in some of the tanks and see how that affects the center of mass.<color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> on each of the fuel tanks and drag the fuel and oxidizer propellant levels down to 0 (DON'T touch the MonoPropellant levels, as they wont be burnt by the "Terrier" engine).As you are doing this, you will see the CoM move. During flight the vessel's CoM will move in the same way as it burns it's fuel, until the tanks are empty.
			#autoLOC_313037 = Next
			#autoLOC_313053 = Refill the Tank
			#autoLOC_313061 = Ok, now go ahead and refill the tanks and we can proceed to add some of the "accessories" to our upper stage.They'll transform it from merely something that gets us into orbit into something that helps us once we're there.
			#autoLOC_313062 = Next
			#autoLOC_313078 = Where to Place RCS Thrusters
			#autoLOC_313088 = Now that you know where the CoM is when the stage is full and when it is empty, you have the information you need to place RCS thrusters. RCS thrusters are found in the Command and Control category.Moving the spaceship without rotating it is called "translation." This is a useful kind of maneuver for several reasons, including docking to another craft. In order for translation with RCS to avoid unwanted rotation, you need to balance the thrusters around the CoM, so the net sum of forces is balanced right on this natural pivot point. For two equal sets of thrusters, each set should be equidistant from the CoM, and for a single set (what we're doing here) they should be right around the CoM itself.What makes this complicated is that the CoM changes during flight, as you just saw. So, you need to place the thrusters at a compromise point between the 'wet' CoM and the 'dry' CoM.Note that in career-mode games, RCS thrusters don't become available until fairly late. In the meantime, the reaction wheel capability built into your command pod will probably be enough for turning in space, though reaction wheels will not allow you to translate.
			#autoLOC_313089 = Next
			#autoLOC_313105 = Placing the RCS Thrusters
			#autoLOC_313115 = Let's turn on Angle Snap to make aligning the thruster parts easier. Do that by clicking on the Toggle Snap icon in the lower left or pressing the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key, ensure we have <color=<<3>>>4x</color> symmetry turned on, and then place a set of <color=<<4>>>4 RV-105 RCS Thruster Blocks</color> on your upper stage.The tiny rocket propellant tank is about the right place to attach these. (Just in case you need a hint.) If you don't get the placement quite right, you can also use the Offset gizmo to fine-tune their position. Make sure you turn angle snap off before using the offset! You will want fine adjustments for that, and with snap turned on, the adjustments are anything but fine. Click the Offset Mode icon in the upper left of the main editor window (just to the right of the part list), then click an RCS part. Drag one of the axis indicators to move it. If you want to reset this adjustment, hit <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color>. When done, go back to Place mode.When you're all done, turn the CoM indicator off.
			#autoLOC_313116 = Next
			#autoLOC_313132 = Electric Charge
			#autoLOC_313143 = Lots of things on a craft use Electric Charge (EC). (That's what us cool scientists call rocket electricity.)In order to keep your batteries topped up, you will need a way of generating power. Now, some engines generate electricity while they're running, but you don't want to keep your engine running in orbit. Your orbit would get all kinds of messed up, and you'll run out of propellant!Our command pod has some batteries built into it, but to be safe you can add more batteries, and you can add solar panels or other electricity-generating items. We're going to do both.
			#autoLOC_313144 = Next
			#autoLOC_313157 = Adding Batteries and Solar Panels
			#autoLOC_313166 = Switch to the <color=<<1>>>Electrical</color> category now and ensure we have Angle Snap turned on and are still in <color=<<2>>>4x</color> Symmetry mode.We'll use our part rotation skills to adjust the panels before placing them. Thats the <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>, <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color>, <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color>, <color=<<9>>>[<<10>>]</color>, <color=<<11>>>[<<12>>]</color> and <color=<<13>>>[<<14>>]</color> keys we used earlier.Grab the <color=<<15>>>OX-STAT</color> solar panel, hold it over the lower end of the fuel tanks, and press <color=<<16>>>[<<17>>]</color> to rotate it 90 degrees. Then <color=<<18>>>click</color> to place a set of them.Now go ahead and place a set of 4 <color=<<19>>>Z-100</color> batteries between the solar panels.
			#autoLOC_313167 = Next
			#autoLOC_313183 = Upper Stage Complete
			#autoLOC_313194 = Excellent work. You've built a nice starter upper stage which will do well for some orbital exploration.Now we need to work on getting it up to orbit, and for that we'll build up our lower stage. In comparison to the upper stage, it's quite simple \u2014 just a couple of tanks and an engine. That won't be enough alone however, so we'll add some boosters too.
			#autoLOC_313195 = Next
			#autoLOC_313208 = Stage Decoupler
			#autoLOC_313218 = Add another <color=<<1>>>TD-12 Stack Decoupler</color> on the bottom of the "Terrier".We'll need this during our ascent to discard the empty parts of the vessel below.Oh, and notice how when you add the decoupler, a fairing is placed around the engine? This will get jettisoned automatically when we stage the decoupler.
			#autoLOC_313219 = Next
			#autoLOC_313235 = Add Tanks
			#autoLOC_313243 = Now we need to add the fuel tanks for our lower stage.Add two of the medium (rocket) propellant tanks (<color=<<1>>>FL-T400 Fuel Tank</color>) to the bottom of the stack.
			#autoLOC_313244 = Next
			#autoLOC_313260 = Add a Swivel Engine
			#autoLOC_313268 = For our lower stage we need an engine that is a sustainer. That's an engine that burns from liftoff until well after the boosters separate.Let's get "Scientifical" for a second. Rocket engine performance is measured by Specific Impulse (or Isp), and the Isp of an engine changes as the amount of atmospheric pressure around it changes. Just as the upper stage needed an engine that is good at the low air pressures of high altitudes, the lower stage will need boosters which are powerful at the higher air pressure of the low altitude of the launch pad. And to help carry the rocket through the transition from launch to upper stage, it will need a "sustainer" engine which usually sits between boosters and upper stage engines from a performance perspective, having a wide range in between the two.So add the big engine you see there, the <color=<<1>>>LV-T45 "Swivel"</color>, to the bottom of the tanks as our sustainer.
			#autoLOC_313269 = Next
			#autoLOC_313285 = Tweak the Swivel
			#autoLOC_313293 = At its default thrust level, the "Swivel" is too powerful for the rocket we're creating (and for the ascent profile we're going to teach you in the "Go For Orbit" tutorial). So you'll need to lower its thrust level. This isn't as good a solution as picking a smaller, lighter engine with the thrust level we want, but, well, there are only so many options. <color=<<1>>>Right-click</color> the "Swivel" and lower its thrust limiter to 65. It will then only produce 65% of its full thrust potential, but it will also run longer because it's only burning 65% as much fuel.
			#autoLOC_313294 = Next
			#autoLOC_313310 = Add Radial Decouplers
			#autoLOC_313318 = Nice. You now have the core of your rocket completed, but as I said before, we'll also be adding boosters to help the sustainer engine get the rocket up and running.We'll add two boosters symmetrically so that we keep our craft balanced, and to make sure we don't lug the useless dry mass of the boosters around after they burn out, we'll attach them using decouplers.This time, however, we'll use radial decouplers so the boosters can sit beside our lower stage core instead of under it. That way, the sustainter and boosters can fire at the same time. Select the <color=<<1>>>TT-38K Radial Decoupler</color> and add it in <color=<<2>>>2x</color> symmetry near the bottom of the lowest tank on the lower stage.
			#autoLOC_313319 = Next
			#autoLOC_313335 = Add SRBs
			#autoLOC_313343 = "Moar Boosters" is something you often hear around the KSC, and now it's time to add some!Add a pair of <color=<<1>>>RT-10 "Hammer"</color> SRBs to the decouplers, so we have that extra kick early on.
			#autoLOC_313344 = Next
			#autoLOC_313359 = Tweak SRB Thrust
			#autoLOC_313367 = Unlike LF (Liquid Fuel) engines, where you can adjust the throttle during flight, once you light an SRB, it burns at constant thrust till it's out of fuel. We can, however, use the throttle limiter as we did on the "Swivel" to set that constant thrust before we roll out to the launchpad.<color=<<1>>>Right-Click</color> on one of the SRBs and change its thrust limiter to 50. Do note that changing a tweakable value on one part that's been placed using symmetry will have that same change applied to its symmetry counterparts.(Remember when I said I'd teach you how to make that pod-and-Thumper craft from Construction Basics survivable? Well, this thrust adjusting is how that could be done. Although you'd also have to put a decoupler on it.)
			#autoLOC_313368 = Next
			#autoLOC_313384 = Add Nose Cones
			#autoLOC_313392 = Right now the SRBs have flat, pancake tops, which is simply not a good look. Oh, and bad aerodynamically.Let's fix that by adding a pair of nose cones. <color=<<1>>>Nose cones</color> can be found in the <color=<<2>>>Aerodynamics</color> category, and you can add a pair of them using <color=<<3>>>2x</color> symmetry.
			#autoLOC_313393 = Next
			#autoLOC_313409 = Add Fins
			#autoLOC_313417 = While we're on that tab in the toolbox, let's add some fins too. Fins come in various sizes and styles, and as we learned earlier, will help stabilize your craft.Since these fins are control surfaces, they also add some extra control authority when low in the atmosphere, where the air is thick enough for them to have a helpful effect.Add the <color=<<1>>>AV-R8 Winglets</color> in <color=<<2>>>4x</color> symmetry near the bottom of the lowest fuel tank in the lowest stage, and make sure they don't intersect the decouplers and SRBs. If they do overlap those parts, any flight will be interesting, but exceptionally short.
			#autoLOC_313418 = Next
			#autoLOC_313434 = Fix Staging
			#autoLOC_313442 = Excellent! We've now got all the components on our basic orbital rocket, but let's run through a few extra things before we call it a day.Firstly, we should review the Staging Stack to check the order of actions and parts displayed there. It's lucky I've highlighted this for you, because the SRBs are set to fire before the sustainer, and that just won't do. You won't have enough thrust to get off the pad that way!Move the Swivel's staging icon down into the same stage as the SRBs.Note that the automatically created staging sequence would work if we did not want the long-burning sustainer to ignite at the same time as the high-thrust boosters, but since we do, we had to adjust it manually.
			#autoLOC_313443 = Next
			#autoLOC_313459 = Align for Launch
			#autoLOC_313467 = Finally, pick up the pod and rotate it 90 degrees around the vertical axis (Press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> or <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>).This will rotate the ship not just in the VAB, but also set its orientation when we go to the launchpad, so that our desired flight heading of east (compass 90) will be a matter of steering in the pitch (up-and-down) axis rather than yaw (right-and-left).By default, parts in the VAB are oriented so that they are aligned north.
			#autoLOC_313468 = Next
			#autoLOC_313484 = Action Groups
			#autoLOC_313493 = We always make every effort to ensure our brave crew survive, and hopefully you will take the same stance in your space program. It doesn't always work out that way, of course, but it's the thought that counts. (At least to those of us not in the rocket at the time.) With that in mind, let's set up an abort action group for your craft, for use in case of emergency. Note that in career mode, you'll have to upgrade the VAB or SPH in order to access action groups.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the turquoise action groups button on the left of the toolbar; it's part of a cluster of three buttons.
			#autoLOC_313494 = Next
			#autoLOC_313510 = Action Groups
			#autoLOC_313518 = Action groups let you assign the functions of one or more parts to a single, specific key. There are some default action groups (landing gear automatically go in the gear group, brakes on wheels go in the brake group, etc.) and some custom ones activated by the keyboard (not keypad) numbers. Because of the order of these keys on standard boards, the action groups are numbered 1 through 9 and then 0.To set up an action group, click on the desired action key from the menu, then click on the part you want to activate. The actions already assigned to that group appear in the Group Actions column, and the actions that can be assigned from the selected part appear in the Selection Column.To add and remove items, you simply click on them to move them left or right between columns. To clear all action group selections from a part, click Reset in the Selection column.We're going to set up the Abort action group. It's triggered by pressing <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> or by clicking the big red abort button in flight (it slides out from the left of the altitude panel at the top of the screen when you mouse over that area). First, <color=<<3>>>click</color> on the <color=<<4>>>Abort</color> button in the Action Groups column.
			#autoLOC_313519 = Next
			#autoLOC_313535 = Abort Group
			#autoLOC_313543 = Great! Now <color=<<1>>>click</color> on the decoupler right below the pod, and add its <color=<<2>>>Decouple</color> action to the group.Then <color=<<3>>>click</color> on each liquid engine in turn and assign their <color=<<4>>>Shutdown</color> functions to the group. Finally, <color=<<5>>>click</color> on one of the radial decouplers and assign <color=<<6>>>Decouple</color> to the group. (Since these were placed with symmetry, applying the action to one radial decoupler will apply it to them all.) Now when you trigger the abort action in flight, the engines will shut down (or, if they can't shut down, be decoupled), the capsule will separate from the rest of the ship, and it should be safe to land by itself. Remember to deploy your parachute once it's safe, however! (This may require staging a number of times, since the stage counter won't advance by itself when parts decouple before they are staged.
			#autoLOC_313544 = Next
			#autoLOC_313560 = Summary
			#autoLOC_313568 = And there we are! Your orbital rocket is ready to fly.It's been a long lesson (and thanks for hanging in there) in which we've covered lots of different advanced techniques for rocket construction.Give the new ship a name and save it \u2014 that's always a good practice. Then I recommend you try flying it in the "Go For Orbit" tutorial.<color=<<1>>>NOTE:Any vessels you create here will be lost when you exit, this is just for playing around.</color>
			#autoLOC_313569 = Done
			#autoLOC_314034 = Intermediate Construction
			#autoLOC_314043 = Hello again. Glad you could come back.To get started, go ahead and enter the VAB and I'll give you the overview of what we're building today.
			#autoLOC_314055 = Overview
			#autoLOC_314077 = Ah, here we are again. Now, to business.If you remember, in our last construction tutorial we covered how to build a simple hopper and some of the basics of the construction area.In this tutorial we'll expand your knowledge of some of the more useful features in the VAB, and we'll build a more complex craft that will be able to get us out of the atmosphere.
			#autoLOC_314078 = Next
			#autoLOC_314093 = Loading Saved Designs
			#autoLOC_314106 = To build our new design let's start with the craft we built in the Basic Construction Tutorial, though this one is just called "Hopper". This will save us a little bit of time, and the accounting department is always happy when we save on time.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> on the <color=<<2>>>Open</color> button in the top right corner and load the "Hopper", then remove its <color=<<3>>>RT-5 "Flea"</color> motor.If you mess up, you can recreate the craft from the part list by placing a pod first, then a parachute on top of it. Note that throughout this tutorial I will leave all parts you need available to be placed.If you delete the craft file somehow, close the load dialog and open it again and the craft will be back.
			#autoLOC_314107 = Next
			#autoLOC_314126 = Tweaking the Chute
			#autoLOC_314140 = Unlike last time, we won't be bringing the whole vessel back, so we can change our parachute's stats from what we used before. Right-click on the parachute and verify that its deployment altitude is set to 1000m as last time, but also set the minimum pressure slider all the way to the right, 0.75 atmospheres. That corresponds to an altitude on Kerbin of about 2 kilometers and means a much shorter time 'hanging around' during descent.
			#autoLOC_314141 = Next
			#autoLOC_314156 = Renaming the Vessel
			#autoLOC_314166 = First off let's change the name of our craft, and the description if you want, so that we still have our trash can special for later on.Simply change the name to something other than "Hopper" and we can proceed.
			#autoLOC_314167 = Next
			#autoLOC_314181 = Adding Some Extra Functionality
			#autoLOC_314189 = Great. For this craft, we are going to give the ship some additional purpose by attaching a science experiment. We can run these experiments during our travels and get valuable science data for Kerbalkind.There are a number of science experiments to be performed, but at the moment we only have the Mystery Goo Containment Unit available.Switch to the <color=<<1>>>Science</color> tab to look at it. This is one of the most basic scientific experiments Kerbal scientists have devised and one of the first things they want to try and understand better; I mean, they don't even know what color the goo is!
			#autoLOC_314190 = Next
			#autoLOC_314205 = Using Symmetry
			#autoLOC_314213 = When you pick up the part you will see that it's designed to attach to the sides of other parts, i.e.  "radially". If we attach only one of these, then during flight our craft will be unbalanced.One way to solve this is to add an extra Goo Container on the opposite side of the rocket so they balance. Luckily we have a symmetry tool to help here.
			#autoLOC_314216 = These buttons control symmetry (highlighted) and angle snap, and can be found in the lower left of the screen. Press the <color=<<1>>>symmetry</color> button (or press the <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> key) to cycle through the available symmetry modes.
			#autoLOC_314218 = Set this to <color=<<1>>>2x</color> and then pick up and place a <color=<<2>>>Mystery Goo Containment Unit</color> on the side of the pod, near the top. You will notice that a second one has been placed opposite the first by the symmetry tool. If you had already placed a lone canister, pick it up, make sure symmetry is set correctly, and place it again, so that it has a duplicate on the other side.Remember to place the canisters near the nose of the pod!
			#autoLOC_314219 = Next
			#autoLOC_314233 = Decoupling Parts
			#autoLOC_314242 = If we add too many more parts here, the craft we are making will be too heavy to survive reentry safely (and too heavy to be slowed by our parachute, leading to Sudden Impact Syndrome). So we will need to add a decoupler below the pod.Decouplers can be found in the Coupling tab, and will let us split the craft when we no longer need the lower parts. We won't be able to recover the discarded parts, but at least our craft (and our Kerbal!) will survive reentry and landing.Decouplers can be used in many ways, but for now let's just add one of these to the bottom of the pod. Go to the <color=<<1>>>Coupling</color> tab, grab a <color=<<2>>>TD-12</color>, and place it.Note that stack decouplers have arrows. The arrows show which side is the side that decouples. Make sure your decoupler's arrow is pointing up, towards the pod. (It will be, by default.)
			#autoLOC_314243 = Next
			#autoLOC_314257 = Revisiting the Staging Stack
			#autoLOC_314266 = Well done. You'll recall, I hope, that in the previous tutorial we had to adjust the staging stack when we added the engine to our earlier rocket. When you add a decoupler, the extra stage is automatically added to the stack so that any new parts below the decoupler won't be staged at the same time as those above it.You can of course still move these all around, but hopefully this will save you some time as you go.If you ever want to return to this default staging setup, click the <color=<<1>>>Reset</color> button at the bottom of the Staging Stack.
			#autoLOC_314267 = Next
			#autoLOC_314281 = Adding Some Fuel Tanks
			#autoLOC_314289 = This time we are going to use a Liquid Propellant Rocket Engine. Unlike Solid Rocket Motors, these engines don't carry their own propellants with them, so we need to add some fuel tanks.Go to the Fuel Tanks tab. We are still using these early parts so there are only FLT-100s available. This is another area, like engines, where advancement brings bigger and better parts.We are going to need 5 of these tanks to get us to space. Before you grab 5 tanks from the part toolbox, though, let me give you another tip, because efficency is my middle name (it goes right after "Von").Once you place the first tank on the rocket, you can duplicate that by holding the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> Key and clicking on the tank. You can do this on the bottom tank a few times and quickly get 5 of these attached without having to go back to the toolbox.Add 5 <color=<<3>>>FLT-100 Fuel Tanks</color> to the vessel and we can proceed.
			#autoLOC_314290 = Next
			#autoLOC_314304 = Adding a Rocket Engine
			#autoLOC_314312 = Good! Switch over to the <color=<<1>>>Engines</color> tab now.The "Swivel" engine you see here is obviously different from the "Flea" we used before. This is a liquid engine and it needs (and burns) both Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer; funnily enough, that's what we just added to the rocket.Attach the <color=<<2>>>LV-T45 "Swivel"</color> to the bottom of the rocket stack now, and keep an eye on the staging stack to see how it changes.
			#autoLOC_314313 = Next
			#autoLOC_314327 = Adding Fins for Balance
			#autoLOC_314335 = We are almost there and you're doing fine, maybe not as speedily as someone of my caliber though.The last thing we are going to need to do is to give this rocket a little better stability, so it keeps going the way we want it to go. We will achieve this by adding some fins near the bottom of the rocket. Fins can be found in the <color=<<1>>>Aerodynamics</color> tab.Set the symmetry mode to <color=<<2>>>4x</color> so we will place them on both axes. Also, turn on angle snap.
			#autoLOC_314338 = You can turn on angle snap by clicking the button next to the symmetry icon (highlighted blue in this example), or by pressing <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>. That will help you to align the fins neatly.
			#autoLOC_314340 = Drop a <color=<<1>>>Basic Fin</color> on the last rocket tank. You'll see the other three symmetry counterparts will be placed as well.
			#autoLOC_314341 = Next
			#autoLOC_314355 = Ready to Rock!
			#autoLOC_314364 = Excellent, we've now got a rocket that will let us reach for the stars. Admittedly, I did say "reach for", as this is a basic rocket which can't achieve orbit. But on the bright side, that means reentry will also be basic!You've done a great job in building a basic hopper and a suborbit-capable rocket. Hopefully, you've learned a few things about how to build a craft and how to use some of the shortcuts that are in here.Feel free to hang around a bit and try your hand at other things too, or perhaps you could look at the next lesson on suborbital flight, where we will see just how well this rocket performs. Or, head over to the science tutorial to learn how to advance your career and unlock more parts.If you could show yourself out of the construction facility with the red button on the top right when you're done experimenting that would be great. Auf wiedersehen!<color=<<1>>>NOTE:Any vessels you create here will be lost when you exit, this is just for playing around.</color>
			#autoLOC_314365 = Done
			#autoLOC_314461 = Welcome
			#autoLOC_314470 = Welcome to the Kerbal Space Center Launch Facility! I'm <<1>> and I will teach you the basics of piloting a spacecraft.I trust you've already checked the Basic Construction Tutorial, if not I recommend you do so before going through this one.Today we will do a run through of all the important controls for your spacecraft. Our little "Hopper" from your Basic Construction lesson with Wernher may not have all of them, but we'll do a full run through once, and see how it flys.If you're ready to go, press <color=<<2>>>Next</color>.
			#autoLOC_314471 = Next
			#autoLOC_314482 = Basic Flight Controls
			#autoLOC_314489 = Flying a spacecraft is all about being in control of a generally very chaotic situation. As a Pilot, your main flight controls will affect the pitch, yaw and roll of the ship.Let's look at those first. (All the other controls will be locked until they're needed or this tutorial is closed.)
			#autoLOC_314490 = Next
			#autoLOC_314502 = Basic Flight Controls : Pitch, Yaw and Roll
			#autoLOC_314509 = Pitch, Yaw and Roll are the three directions you will rotate your craft.To help you visualize these, we've taken a holiday snap of the "Hopper" below.
			#autoLOC_314511 = Next up, we'll see how we rotate in these directions.
			#autoLOC_314512 = Next
			#autoLOC_314523 = Pitch, Yaw and Roll
			#autoLOC_314532 = You control your ship's rotation using the these controls:  <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> / <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>  : Pitch Up / Down  <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color> / <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color>  : Yaw Left / Right  <color=<<9>>>[<<10>>]</color> / <color=<<11>>>[<<12>>]</color>  : Roll Left / RightBy controlling Pitch, Yaw and Roll together, you can keep the ship in a controlled flight.Try it now, and notice the indicator on the lower-left side move as you provide control input.
			#autoLOC_314533 = Next
			#autoLOC_314544 = Basic Flight Controls
			#autoLOC_314551 = Throttle, plus Pitch, Yaw and Roll are the main controls you'll need to master for a successful, crash-free flight.We'll skip over the Throttle control for now as this vessel has no need for it. Don't worry, I'll explain it another time when it's of use.Remember that all of these controls have a limited amount of effectiveness, so bigger, heavier ships will probably respond much more sluggishly to the controls than a little small one.It's also good to keep in mind that as stages are separated from the ship, it will become lighter and this will usually mean easier to control.Next, let's look at the rest of the Flight Controls.
			#autoLOC_314552 = Next
			#autoLOC_314563 = Staging
			#autoLOC_314570 = In flight, all the planning you put into the staging sequence of your ship comes into play.From launch to the final deployment of the descent parachute(s), you can control the activation of several of the ship's parts by activating stages:  <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> : Launch/Activate Next StageNotice the Stage Indicator in the lower-left corner, it shows the currently active stage. Since we haven't launched yet, it's showing the first stage as active. I have your staging controls locked for now, so the stage indicator is glowing purple. One more thing on staging, if the staging setup is causing strife, or you change your mind about something, you can edit the stage sequence on the fly...pun intended...no need to go back to the assembly facility.
			#autoLOC_314571 = Next
			#autoLOC_314582 = The NavBall
			#autoLOC_314589 = An important part of flying is knowing how your ship is oriented and where it is going. That's why a good pilot is always aware of the ship's Attitude (where it is pointing) and its Velocity Vector (where it is going). These aren't always the same direction, and as your skills improve you should pick up on these.The big round instrument on the lower center of the screen is called the NavBall. This device sums up most of the critical information needed for proper, death-free flight.Here, you see the ship's nose in relation to the horizon (when you're not pointing straight up its easily visible as a line between blue sky and the brown ground), as well as its heading (compass bearing) and speed.You also get several icons that indicate things like your current velocity vector, but we'll have a look at those later.
			#autoLOC_314590 = Next
			#autoLOC_314601 = Flight Instruments
			#autoLOC_314608 = In the top-center part of the screen you have your Altimeter, Vertical Speed Indicator, and Atmosphere gauges.The Altimeter will show the distance to the planet's surface at Sea Level. This means the actual surface may be much closer, so watch out for the ground when landing.Your Vertical Speed Indicator shows how quickly your altitude is changing. When launching, it's considered best to keep this gauge pointing up.The Atmosphere gauge indicates how deep the ship is in the planet's atmosphere. This helps you know if the ship is high enough for orbiting without losing speed to air resistance, or judge how effective wings and controls surfaces will be.
			#autoLOC_314609 = Next
			#autoLOC_314620 = Parachute Indicators
			#autoLOC_314627 = One last thing before we give this rocket the green light.In the Staging stack you can see the indicator for your parachute. This indicator shows when the chute will be activated by staging\u2014you already know that\u2014but the background will also change color to indicate when it is safe to stage the parachute, and the foreground (the parachute bit of the icon itself) will change color depending on the parachute's state. <b>Note, however, that by default parachutes will not deploy when unsafe, even if you stage them.</b>
			#autoLOC_314629 = The left three show safety: Safe, Risky, and Unsafe to deploy. The chute is unstaged (white) in the left three. The right three show state after staging: Armed, Deployed, and Cut/shredded. When you are familiar with chute icon colors we can move on.
			#autoLOC_314630 = Next
			#autoLOC_314642 = Ready to Launch
			#autoLOC_314660 = Ok, enough talk! I'll unlock the flight controls and you'll be clear for launch.At any time you may press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to pause the game. In the Pause Menu you can restart the flight, or end this Tutorial (choose <color=<<3>>>End Scenario</color>) and return to the Main Menu.For now get, yourself prepared and hit <color=<<4>>>[<<5>>]</color> when ready to launch!Don't forget our "Hopper" has only a solid rocket motor so there is no throttle control\u2014that's why we didn't review the throttle here. <b>Make sure to fly in a nice high arc and enjoy the flight!</b>
			#autoLOC_314671 = Liftoff!
			#autoLOC_314692 = And up you go! You can try practicing some of the controls we just discussed like pitch, yaw and roll.Also keep an eye on the parachute icon in the staging list, that shows you how safe the current environment is for chutes. Once it goes red it won't deploy until it's clear again even if you stage it.I realize this could be too much to learn in one go, so if you forget you can always press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> and click <color=<<3>>>View Key Bindings</color> for a reminder.You can also see whether your crew are enjoying the trip in the lower right corner.Anyways, I'll hang around and watch, and I'll let you know when it's safe to stage your chute.
			#autoLOC_314708 = Deploy the Parachute
			#autoLOC_314715 = Your solid motor has burned out, you're passing apoapsis (the highest point on your flight), and your speed is low enough that it's safe to stage again to deploy the parachute.Do so now, before you speed up again and hit the surface!
			#autoLOC_314727 = Descending...
			#autoLOC_314734 = You've armed the parachute, now time to wait to get low enough and slow down enough for it to deploy safely (don't worry, it will do so automatically now).Well, maybe worry slightly: If you didn't fly high enough, you may not have enough air under you to slow down before you crash!
			#autoLOC_314746 = Enjoy the Descent
			#autoLOC_314754 = And now we sit back and enjoy the descent.
			#autoLOC_314766 = Landed
			#autoLOC_314775 = Well done, you've survived your first quick flight!When you're landed or splashed on Kerbin (and NOT in training) you can point the mouse just above the altimeter and click the recover button (on the panel that slides down) to ask to be picked up.I've also unlocked the crew hatch, so if you feel like going out for a walk or swim you can click the EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) button that will pop up when you mouse over the portrait of the Kerbal you want to take for a walk. You can do it just for fun, or to collect a surface sample.This concludes today's lesson, to exit training you press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to access the pause menu and choose <color=<<3>>>(End Scenario</color>) to return to the Main Menu.I hope to see you again to learn more about Suborbital flight perhaps. Bye.
			#autoLOC_314776 = Done
			#autoLOC_314788 = Internal View
			#autoLOC_314800 = Aha!, You're a curious one aren't you? The IVA button over each crewmember's portrait will let you see the ship from his own perspective.Note that in this mode, your flight UI has less instruments, since most of them can be found in the cockpit itself.In Internal View, right-clicking will toggle between mouse-look and interact modes, so you can look aroud without having to hold down the right mouse button. Try looking around and clicking on things, the Engineering department says there are many devices in here that actually work. They seemed to be quite proud of that, in fact.When there are multiple crew you can cycle through the POV of them using the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key.Return to External View by pressing <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>.
			#autoLOC_314820 = Failure
			#autoLOC_314830 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here. You might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission, you know...Don't feel bad, I'll send someone to clean that up and you can try again. <b>Make sure you fly high enough to be going slow enough for parachute deployment, and make sure you remember to stage it to arm it!</b>
			#autoLOC_314831 = Finish
			#autoLOC_314847 = Oh No! Your Chute is Gone!
			#autoLOC_314857 = You staged your chute while still going too fast and it ripped up. Afraid there really isn't much that can be done now, it's shredded to ribbons!
			#autoLOC_314876 = Docking Control Mode
			#autoLOC_314887 = I see you've found the Docking Controls. In this mode, controls behave somewhat differently, to make maneuvering around in orbit easier. However, that is a topic for a whole other tutorial, so let's just go back to the subject at hand for now.Press the Staging button on the bottom-left corner to return to the Staging Control Mode.
			#autoLOC_315017 = Welcome
			#autoLOC_315026 = Hello again. Glad you could make it back.Today we will take an exciting step: getting our first Kerbal into Space! (Yep, with a capital S!)Hopefully, you remember the controls we discussed in the basic flight tutorial, but don't forget that you can always press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> and click the view key bindings button for a reminder.If you're ready, let's get started.
			#autoLOC_315027 = Next
			#autoLOC_315041 = Flight Plan
			#autoLOC_315054 = Your mission today is to make a short suborbital (less than orbital) flight out over the water to the east. It's a nice arcing path that ensures a gentle, survivable reentry; straight up then straight down is...not so good for survival.I've set up the pink target indicator on the navball as aim point but do note that this is not the case for normal missions (the target marker is normally used for other things, and does not help with ascents). Starting with the nose pointing straight up on the launch pad, or 90 degrees elevation from the eastern horizon:  * Tilt east to 80 degrees elevation on the navball by 150 m/s (start at 50 m/s);  * Tilt east to 70 degrees on the navball by 400 m/s (start at 250 m/s);  * After burnout, coast up into space, and have a look around;  * Prepare for reentry;  * Lastly, reenter and land safely!Once we reach burnout (i.e.run out of propellant) we'll have a bit more time to discuss some other things.
			#autoLOC_315055 = Next
			#autoLOC_315069 = Throttle Control
			#autoLOC_315079 = Unlike the "Hopper" in our first lesson, this new craft has Liquid Fuel engines. This means we can use the throttle to set the output power of the ship's engines.Throttle is controlled by the following keys:  <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> : Throttle Up  <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> : Throttle Down  <color=<<5>>>[<<6>>]</color> : Throttle Max  <color=<<7>>>[<<8>>]</color> : Throttle CutoffTry these out now! You'll see the indicator needle slide up and down along the graph on the lower left side of the navball.
			#autoLOC_315080 = Next
			#autoLOC_315094 = S.A.S.
			#autoLOC_315103 = S.A.S stands for Stability Augmentation System, although Kerbal astronauts usually refer to it as Sickness Avoidance Scheme.Whatever it stands for, what it does is try to stop the ship from spinning around, using the computer-controlled "Auto-Torque Drive Compensator" technology to counteract the rotation of the ship. In its simplest mode it will keep the ship aligned with the orientation it has when you turn S.A.S. on, or, if you pitch/yaw/roll while S.A.S. is on, the orientation when you release the controls.SAS can be activated (or deactivated if on) momentarily by holding down the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key, and it can be toggled by pressing the <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> key.If you have problems following the maneuvers, once you enable SAS and lift off you can click the small red button to the left of the navball that has a miniature target indicator (it's the lower left of all the buttons). That will cause the S.A.S. to follow the target indicator and fly for you. Note: this autopiloting function will not be available until you are flying.
			#autoLOC_315104 = Next
			#autoLOC_315118 = Launch Preparations
			#autoLOC_315125 = This craft has a bit too much engine, so we're going to throttle down for launch. Set your throttle to <color=<<1>>>2/3</color> (the upper of the two middle notches on the slider).Also, turn on S.A.S. to help control things (press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color>). It will keep you pointed where you want to be pointed.
			#autoLOC_315126 = Next
			#autoLOC_315144 = Detailed Information Ahead
			#autoLOC_315153 = During this lesson some of the information is quite detailed and could take a while to read. As this is a short suborbital hop, and I don't want you to miss anything important, I will place a warning at the top of pages where you might want to pause the game to read.The warning will look like this:<color=<<1>>>WARNING</color>: Detailed info! Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> to pause if necessary.
			#autoLOC_315154 = Next
			#autoLOC_315168 = Ready to Launch
			#autoLOC_315190 = Ok, enough talk! I'll unlock the rest of the flight controls and you'll be clear to launch.At any time you may press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to pause the game. In the Pause Menu you can restart the flight, or end this Tutorial and return to the Main Menu.I've enabled the Target marker on the NavBall. Give it a look to make sure you see it, and then let's get ready to light this candle.Double-check your throttle is set to <color=<<3>>>2/3</color> (the upper of the two middle notches on the slider) and S.A.S. is enabled, then hit <color=<<4>>>[<<5>>]</color> when you're ready to launch. Remember to start turning at 50m/s!
			#autoLOC_315202 = Hold Tight...
			#autoLOC_315210 = Wait for a bit more speed before we start to turn.
			#autoLOC_315227 = Start the Turn
			#autoLOC_315235 = Now's the time to start turning.Follow the target marker to 80 degrees by the time you reach 150m/s.
			#autoLOC_315260 = Hold Steady Again
			#autoLOC_315268 = Good work!Get ready to turn further once you reach 250m/s.
			#autoLOC_315286 = Steady on 70
			#autoLOC_315294 = Looking good! Now let's turn a little more.We are aiming to get to the 70 degree pitch line.You can follow the marker as it moves there.
			#autoLOC_315313 = Hold Steady - Throttle Up
			#autoLOC_315321 = Excellent work. We've got the rocket just where it needs to be in order to reach space.You should be able to let S.A.S. keep the craft steady for a while as we accelerate further.Now go ahead and throttle up to full power.
			#autoLOC_315358 = Hold Steady
			#autoLOC_315366 = We're really cooking along now! As we get up to these higher speeds you might start to see some heat effects, but we will clear the atmosphere before it gets too hot .Hold the course and we'll reach stage burnout safely.
			#autoLOC_315403 = Out of Gas
			#autoLOC_315422 = <color=<<1>>>WARNING</color>: Detailed info! Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> to pause if necessary.Great work! You've succeeded in getting your ship on a trajectory bound for space. I've now set your target indicator to align with your velocity vector; that will minimize drag by turning the smallest side of the vehicle into the air flow. Somewhere around here, you will see the navball speed indicator auto-switch from "Surface" to "Orbit," accompanied by the speed number jumping. Go ahead and switch it back to "Surface" mode by clicking on it until it says "Surface" again.You might have noticed some flickering flames near the end of our burn there, which is due to the high speed of your craft in the atmosphere. Normally our ascent would be a little slower, but I'm sure my friend Wernher has helped you build a ship that can withstand this heat, and besides this high and this slow you'll be fine.If you want to have a look at your trajectory, you can switch to the map (<color=<<4>>>[<<5>>] </color> key) to have a look at your projected path. Just remember to come back to flight mode again!
			#autoLOC_315424 = Oops. Looks like you're not going to clear the atmosphere<<1>>. Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> and choose <color=<<4>>>Revert Flight</color> to try again.
			#autoLOC_315426 = Next
			#autoLOC_315452 = Coasting to Space
			#autoLOC_315460 = Now that we are coasting our way to apoapsis (that's the highest point on our current projected path), we've got a little time to chat. Once you clear the atmosphere we'll go over what you can do in space.
			#autoLOC_315477 = What to Do in Space
			#autoLOC_315485 = While we float up here beyond the atmosphere, I'll quickly tell you about a couple of things you can do.With an advanced enough astronaut complex in the KSC, we can train our Kerbals to be able to space walk (or EVA), although we won't be doing that on this flight.Also, when we are carrying science devices like our goo containers, we can perform experiments.Feel free to play with the goo canisters now by right-clicking on them. I'll let you know when it's time for the next phase of this suborbital flight.
			#autoLOC_315502 = Reorient
			#autoLOC_315512 = <color=<<1>>>WARNING</color>: Detailed info! Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> to pause if necessary.As we near the edge of the atmosphere again, it's time to reorient the pod to get ready for re-entry. We're only going to reenter with the pod and chute and goo canisters, but we're not going to decouple yet; in real missions it's best to keep your upper stage around until the last moment, you never know when you might need it...Anyway, it's best to re-enter bottom-first, and since we ascended at about 70 degrees pitch, we'll naturally re-enter at about -70 degrees pitch.That means you want to aim the top of the capsule at the 70 degrees pitch line, but the opposite heading. This is at a heading of 270 on the navball and 70 degrees pitch, and I've placed the target marker there to help you see where this lies.Turn S.A.S. off, change your attitude, and then turn it back on again.
			#autoLOC_315531 = Stablize
			#autoLOC_315539 = Nice! Now hold steady on your new attitude (let SAS do its job), and get ready to decouple the stage and start reentry!
			#autoLOC_315558 = Booster Away!
			#autoLOC_315568 = Now it's time to get rid of that booster, since it's just weighing us down.Stage to discard the unneeded parts and mass.
			#autoLOC_315581 = Aerodynamic Stabilization
			#autoLOC_315591 = During re-entry, with your pod oriented this way (drag-producing items near the top), aerodynamic forces alone will hold it properly stabilized.So it's time to turn S.A.S. off and let the air do the work for you. Once it's off and you've hit the atmosphere, we'll move to the next bit.
			#autoLOC_315613 = Reentry!
			#autoLOC_315621 = <color=<<1>>>WARNING</color>: Detailed info! Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> to pause if necessary.You are now reentering Kerbin's atmosphere. Make sure to keep all hands and feet inside the pod at all times. We don't want you getting burnt or anything! Don't mind the flames. Wernher IS a "World Famous Rocket Scientist" after all, and he's built this ship to withstand them.Last time we watched the parachute icon to wait for the right time to open the chute. This time we are going to do something a little different. Remember in the construction tutorial where you designed this vessel, you set the chute to not semi-deploy until 0.75 atmospheres of pressure? That means the chute won't perform the first of its two deployment steps until then, even if you activate it by staging now. On Kerbin, 0.75atm means about 2000m altitude above sea level, and the craft should be travelling slowly enough by then that the chute will survive deployment.So let's take the bold step of arming the chute now and let the smarts in there pop it at the right altitude.You know you can trust me! Stage the chute now by pressing <color=<<4>>>[<<5>>]</color>.
			#autoLOC_315636 = Ready the Chute
			#autoLOC_315644 = <color=<<1>>>WARNING</color>: Detailed info! Press <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> to pause if necessary.Awesome! So while we set your chute to not actually semi-deploy until around 2km (we do look out for you at Mission Control!), we do need to ensure that the opening height (its second, full-deployment step) is correct.You can even adjust these parameters during flight, so right-click on the parachute now and check their sliders.Don't touch the pressure slider (or bad things WILL happen), and make sure the full deploy altitude is no less than 1000m or you will not have enough time to slow down!Once you're satisfied, just hang on until about 2km and watch the parachute trigger itself according to the settings we've chosen.While we're waiting I want you to look at the bottom of the capsule. Note that you do not have a heat shield: you don't need one because this is such a gentle flight. Actually, a heat shield would make things more dangerous on this craft because the additional mass would be pushing the limits of this model of parachute.
			#autoLOC_315659 = Chute Away!
			#autoLOC_315668 = Yes! The chute is away.Now enjoy a leisurely float down to the surface.
			#autoLOC_315681 = Welcome back!
			#autoLOC_315689 = Welcome back, and congratulations on completing \u2014 and even surviving! \u2014 your first real mission.You've managed to launch, control your vessel into space, orient yourself correctly, and land safely. That's quite an achievement.If you want to practice this again, choose revert to launch from the pause menu. Otherwise, end the scenario.And be sure to check out the other tutorials. My next one is about "Going for Orbit" and is really exciting. There's always lots more to learn at the KSC!
			#autoLOC_315690 = Done
			#autoLOC_315708 = Internal View
			#autoLOC_315720 = Aha!, You're a curious one arent' you? The IVA button over each crewmember's portrait will let you see the ship from his own perspective.Note that in this mode, your flight UI has less instruments, since most of them can be found in the cockpit itself.In Internal View, right-clicking will toggle between mouse-look and interact modes, so you can look aroud without having to hold down the right mouse button. Try looking around and clicking on things, the Engineering department says there are many devices in here that actually work. They seemed to be quite proud of that, in fact.When there are multiple crew you can cycle through the POV of them using the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key.Return to External View by pressing <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color>.
			#autoLOC_315740 = Failure
			#autoLOC_315749 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here. You might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission, you know...Don't feel bad, I'll send someone to clean that up and you can try again.
			#autoLOC_315750 = Finish
			#autoLOC_315766 = Oh no! Your chute is gone!
			#autoLOC_315776 = You staged your chute while still going too fast and it ripped up.Afraid there really isn't much that can be done now, it's shredded to ribbons!
			#autoLOC_315795 = Docking Control Mode
			#autoLOC_315806 = I see you've found the Docking Controls.In this mode, controls behave somewhat differently, to make maneuvering around in orbit easier. However, that is a topic for a whole other tutorial, so let's just go back to the subject at hand for now.Press the Staging button on the bottom-left corner to return to the Staging Control Mode.
			#autoLOC_315826 = Whoah, Wipeout!
			#autoLOC_315836 = Uh oh! You've "flipped out" - you pointed your vessel too far away from the direction it was traveling, and the drag from the top of your vessel overpowered the lift and drag from your fins.This means aerodynamic forces acted to keep pushing you further away from your velocity vector rather than acting to keep you aligned.To fix this you'll have to align with your velocity vector again if you can, and then burn straight up.You probably won't make it high enough, however, so you could just restart the lesson.Press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> and choose Revert to try again.
			#autoLOC_315980 = Welcome
			#autoLOC_315989 = Welcome to From the Mun! In our last lesson, we landed this craft on the Mun. Hopefully, your pilot had a chance to stretch her legs and look around; if not we'll start there. After that, we'll be heading home to Kerbin! In this lesson I'll teach you how to take off from the Mun and reach a stable orbit, and then how to return from the Mun (or any moon) to its parent planet. Indeed, the same skill can be used to depart Kerbin towards other planets in the inner solar system. Lastly, I'll cover re-entering Kerbin at high velocity. (Heat shield: required!) When you're ready we can review the flight plan.
			#autoLOC_315990 = Next
			#autoLOC_316004 = Gone Walkabout
			#autoLOC_316014 = To send Valentina on Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA), click the EVA button on her portrait. Have her Jump off the craft and play with the experience of walking in munar gravity. When she's finished frolicking, turn her jetpack on and fly her up to the pod again. She can get back inside by grabbing the handles near the door and then hitting the keystroke to go back inside. Once you're back in the pod, or if you want to skip the EVA, click <color=<<1>>>Next</color>.EVA Controls:  <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color>, <color=<<4>>>[<<5>>]</color>, <color=<<6>>>[<<7>>]</color>, <color=<<8>>>[<<9>>]</color>  : Surface Movement  <color=<<10>>>[<<11>>]</color>  : Toggle Jetpack  <color=<<12>>>[<<13>>]</color>  : Jetpack Up  <color=<<14>>>[<<15>>]</color>  : Jetpack Down  <color=<<16>>>[<<17>>]</color>, <color=<<18>>>[<<19>>]</color>, <color=<<20>>>[<<21>>]</color>, <color=<<22>>>[<<23>>]</color>  : Jetpack Movement
			#autoLOC_316015 = Next
			#autoLOC_316033 = Flight Plan
			#autoLOC_316043 = Ok, moving on. This return flight will have three distinct phases: ascent from the Mun's surface, trans-Kerbin injection, and transmunar re-entry. Once you've finished the first phase, establishing your low munar orbit, we'll cover the details for the next. For now, here's what you're going to do (as always in these lessons, I'll add a target marker to assist your steering): * Throttle up, then immediately pitch over, down the 90 degree heading line (which is east), following the marker. * Cut the throttle when your apoapsis gets above 50km. * Circularize at apoapsis. This will be much simpler than when you did your Kerbin ascent in the Go For Orbit tutorial. The Mun has a much shallower gravity well than Kerbin, so you only need a single stage\u2014 and not even all of that. Remember, this is the same stage you used to land on the Mun, and we're also going to use it to return home. Mun's gravity is so much weaker than Kerbin's, plus we're not being held back by an atmosphere, that this one stage will have the fuel capacity for this entire landing-and-return leg of the mission.
			#autoLOC_316044 = Next
			#autoLOC_316058 = Ready to Launch
			#autoLOC_316074 = I've placed the marker on your navball. When you're ready, throttle up to max (hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>) and immediately start turning. Given your orientation when this tutorial begins, that will be by yawing. Your thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) is very high in the Mun's weak gravity, and again there's no atmosphere to worry about, so you can turn very, very sharply without risking disaster the way this flight path would on Kerbin. We'll be at only 6 degrees pitch by 40m/s. As always, you can use SAS's follow-target mode to follow the marker if you're having trouble. So go ahead, throttle up, and start turning!
			#autoLOC_316086 = On Your Way
			#autoLOC_316093 = Up you go! Or rather, sideways you go!I'll track your apoapsis here so you don't have to swap to map view; cut your engine once it's <<1>>m or more. I'll cut throttle for you if you get very distracted and the apoapsis goes beyond 100km.Note: If your vertical velocity relative to the terrain goes negative, I'll have you pitch up to counteract that.
			#autoLOC_316096 = Current Apoapsis: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_316100 = Current Terrain Alt: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_316104 = Relative vertical speed: <<1>> m/s
			#autoLOC_316106 = Next
			#autoLOC_316132 = Coasting to Apoapsis
			#autoLOC_316157 = Ok! Your throttle is cut, so let's coast on up. I've created the circularization node for you, but in "real life" you'll be doing that planning yourself. Hey, I can't manage every little thing around here! Go ahead and click the <color=<<1>>>Next</color> button when you're ready and we'll warp to the maneuver.
			#autoLOC_316158 = Next
			#autoLOC_316183 = Circularize
			#autoLOC_316191 = We're almost there. Rotate your craft to align it with the blue manuever marker by yourself. or use the S.A.S. <color=<<1>>>Maneuver</color> mode (this aligns your ship with the node's burn vector) to do it for you. Burn to execute the node once your time-to-maneuver is about half the estimated burn time. (As we discussed in a prior tutorial, this makes the burn more efficient and precise.)  If all else fails, burn prograde to make sure your periapsis is no more than 5km lower than your apoapsis\u2014 close enough to a circular orbit for our current purposes.
			#autoLOC_316192 = Next
			#autoLOC_316211 = How To Return
			#autoLOC_316218 = To return from a moon to the body it orbits (or to eject from a planet into solar orbit), you must reach escape velocity, and it matters quite a lot when in your orbit you do so. You want to make sure the effort you expend to reach escape velocity creates the correct resultant orbit. Switch to map view (<color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key) if you're not there already. Zoom far enough out and rotate the camera to show all three objects\u2014your ship, the Mun, and Kerbin\u2014from above. Note your direction of travel in your orbit: if you're looking from the top, you're orbiting counter-clockwise. Next, check the direction of travel of the Mun in its orbit around Kerbin. Mun is orbiting in the same direction as you are: aligned with the rotation of the parent, a "prograde" orbit. We're going to eject opposite to the Mun's direction of travel, but we will be accelerating forward with respect to our own orbit around Mun in order to do that. Let's see how it's done.
			#autoLOC_316219 = Next
			#autoLOC_316237 = Create the Return Node
			#autoLOC_316245 = Remove any existing nodes, then create a new node on your current Mun orbit. It doesn't matter where; we will be moving it to visualize the results of your burn homewards.Drag the prograde handle until you have an escape trajectory (which means that your projected path leaves Mun's SOI). Now drag the node itself and watch as your Kerbin periapsis changes. You'll find that you have the lowest Pe when your ejection vector is parallel to Mun's orbital track but heading the opposite direction. (If the Kerbin Pe disappears under Kerbin's surface, drag on the retrograde handle to reduce the burn until you can see the Pe again. This will keep your reentry survivable.)You've now created an ejection maneuver which, despite being prograde in munar orbit, gives you a retrograde kick in terms of your eventual Kerbin orbit! You can use the same principle to travel to other planets from Kerbin, although there you'll need to be mindful of "transfer windows" (a term for the most efficient times to travel between planets).Once you've set your Kerbin periapsis to be between 5km and 32km, click next to proceed. (You may need to fine-tune by adding radial-in or -out delta-V to the maneuver, or moving the node itself slightly).
			#autoLOC_316246 = Next
			#autoLOC_316312 = Eject!
			#autoLOC_316319 = Warp to and execute the maneuver node you've created. Once that's done, remove the node so we have a clear view of the ship's path. We rocket scientists like tidiness, and it's always good to clean up after yourself! If the resulting orbit deviated from the plotted burn so much that Kerbin periapsis is below 5km or above 32km, you'll need to fine-tune your path with another burn to avoid a possibly disastrous re-entry. A maneuver node could help you to do that. Once your periapsis is within those limits and you have cleared any remaining maneuver nodes, we'll continue.
			#autoLOC_316320 = Next
			#autoLOC_316354 = The Long Road Home
			#autoLOC_316362 = Congratulations! You're on your way home. Let's warp ahead until you're near Kerbin. <color=<<1>>>Click</color> on your orbit near, but at least a Kerbin's-radius away from periapsis, and choose <color=<<2>>>Warp Here</color>. You could alternatively use the timewarp controls by pressing the <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> key, but do remember to decrease warp as you approach; Kerbin's gravity speeds you up a lot as you get close! We'll advance once your altitude drops below 120km. If you used auto-warp, you may want to manually increase timewarp to 5x or 10x once the automatic warp finishes in order to cover the last distance (assuming your auto-warp ended well before 120km altitude).
			#autoLOC_316376 = Prepare for Reentry
			#autoLOC_316388 = Just like I've taught you before, orient retrograde and stabilize, then turn SAS off, then decouple your last stage, and you'll be ready for re-entry. Do that quickly, because you're descending fast!
			#autoLOC_316401 = Reentry!
			#autoLOC_316420 = Note that this time you do have a heat shield on the capsule: while it's just barely possible to survive a transmunar reentry without one, it's very dangerous indeed. Try coming back directly from anywhere farther than the Mun, and you'll be a crispy critter without a shield! An alternative method to avoid excessive re-entry heat would be to maneuver into a parking orbit and/or make a braking burn, and then make a gentler, slower re-entry. That, however, would require a great deal of additional fuel\u2014 and to be honest, is way less fun.Because of the added mass of the heat shield (but no extra drag to compensate because it mounts flush with the pod), this ship won't be able to slow down as well as the pod would by itself. For that reason, your craft has a drogue parachute mounted to the side in addition to the main chute up top. Once the drogue chute icon shows 'safe' (no red or orange background), you can stage to deploy it.Drogue parachutes are weaker braking devices, but work at higher speeds and altitudes than regular parachutes can, in order to slow the ship to the point where it's safe to use the more powerful normal parachutes. So once the drogue is doing its part of the job, we'll continue.
			#autoLOC_316432 = Drogue Away!
			#autoLOC_316452 = Ok, your drogue parachute is staged. Once the main parachute also shows safe, stage again to arm or deploy it as well, and then we'll continue.If for some reason your drogue fails(and goes to the cut state\u2014 red chute icon on any color background) you still have a chance: you might slow down to a safe enough speed to deploy your main parachute even without the drogue. Fingers crossed!
			#autoLOC_316464 = And Now We Wait
			#autoLOC_316472 = With everything staged and activated, there's nothing more to do but wait.
			#autoLOC_316485 = Hurrah! Home Safe!
			#autoLOC_316493 = Congratulations! You've successfully returned from the Mun! A ticker-tape parade would be held in your honor... if this weren't a training simulation. Instead you'll just have to go and do a real Mun mission in your own career or sandbox save!When you're ready, open the pause menu to either end or restart this scenario. And once again: well done!
			#autoLOC_316494 = Done
			#autoLOC_316509 = Summary
			#autoLOC_316518 = Thats as far as I will be taking you today. We can catch up again in the Orbit 101 tutorial where I will show you about orbits and adjusting them.If you want to fly solo for a bit you can also try bringing Valentina home. You will need to turn around 180 degrees and burn retrograde until your periapsis is less than 20km. Stage away the upper stage when you hit the atmosphere's edge, orient retrograde and reenter like I taught you in the Flight Basics tutorial.Or simply choose End Scenario from the Pause menu and I'll see you later.
			#autoLOC_316519 = Finish

			#autoLOC_316548 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here, you might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission. Don't feel bad, you can try again another time.
			#autoLOC_316549 = Finish
			#autoLOC_316653 = Landing on the Mun
			#autoLOC_316662 = Welcome to To The Mun Part 2! In this tutorial you're going to land this vessel on the Mun.In To The Mun Part 1, you brought this vessel, along with its transfer stage, to low lunar orbit. Between the tutorials, that transfer stage was decoupled, so now you're down to just the land-and-return stage.When you're ready to begin, we'll review the flight plan.
			#autoLOC_316663 = Next
			#autoLOC_316678 = Flight Plan
			#autoLOC_316686 = Your flight plan to get to the surface safely will be as follows: * Execute a maneuver at low throttle. * Warp to the new periapsis. * Burn retrograde at medium throttle, reducing speed and altitude, until you are only 1.5km above the surface. * Descend at a measured pace (1m/s of speed per 10m of altitude remaining). * Land softly on the Mun's surface!You'll notice that I've set up a maneuver node for you. This will be your descent orbit insertion burn; it's a burn that will insert you into a descent orbit that almost, but not quite, touches the Mun's surface.
			#autoLOC_316687 = Next
			#autoLOC_316702 = DOI Burn
			#autoLOC_316712 = Go to the map view (press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color>) and warp to the maneuver node as I've taught you. When its "Time to" hits 0, then execute the burn. When done, remove the node.Do this at low throttle so you have better control, since the burn would only take a single second at full throttle!
			#autoLOC_316713 = Next
			#autoLOC_316731 = Fine - Tune Periapsis
			#autoLOC_316738 = Make sure your periapsis is now set 6km. (You might need to go back to map view for this.)If it's not, adjust it as I've taught you by making very fine burns, being careful to throttle up only very slightly so as not to over-do things. If you can't make fine enough corrections burning prograde and retrograde, try burning radial in/out, or even normal/antinormal.
			#autoLOC_316739 = Next
			#autoLOC_316760 = Warp to Periapsis
			#autoLOC_316768 = Now we're going to warp to this new, low periapsis.Click <color=<<1>>>Next</color> when ready!
			#autoLOC_316769 = Next
			#autoLOC_316787 = Warping...
			#autoLOC_316795 = Hang tight and get ready to deploy your landing gear and start your braking burn!You'll be burning at 1/3 throttle (see the marker on the throttle gauge). This is because you want to come in gently and not kill your velocity too soon. If you kill all your speed now, you'll just start falling and pick up more speed again, which you'll have to burn more fuel to re-cancel out. By the way, this path is a 'reverse gravity turn', similar to the one we flew on ascent in the Go For Orbit tutorial. Except, you know, reversed. Anyway, I'm going to enable the target indicator to assist (like we did in the Go For Orbit tutorial). Follow it during the braking burn. If your descent speed gets too high, we'll move to the next step early.
			#autoLOC_316809 = Braking Burn
			#autoLOC_316824 = Ok, we are getting close now. Hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to deploy your landing gear, then throttle up to 1/3 (if you're not there already) and start burning at the target marker! Remember, you can use S.A.S. <color=<<3>>>Target</color> mode to point yourself at the target if you need help.Don't let your vertical speed pass -100m/s, but also don't let it ever go positive, or you'll be wasting fuel by climbing instead of descending.Once you reach only 1.5km up (or earlier if you're descending too quickly) we'll move on. Note: Don't forget that the altimeter up top shows altitude above sea level, not the terrain under you.
			#autoLOC_316828 = Altitude above terrain: <<1>> mVertical Speed: <<2>> m/sSpeed: <<3>> m/s <<4>>
			#autoLOC_316831 = <color=green>THROTTLE DOWN</color>
			#autoLOC_316832 = <color=red>THROTTLE UP</color>
			#autoLOC_316863 = Final Descent Part 1
			#autoLOC_316871 = Almost there! Now you're going to carefully lower your velocity down to zero as you descend. Keep the descent rate equal to your height divided by 10, and keep a look out for a nice place to land!
			#autoLOC_316876 = Altitude above terrain: <<1>> mVertical Speed: <<2>> m/sSpeed: <<3>> m/s <<4>>
			#autoLOC_316880 = <color=green>THROTTLE DOWN</color>
			#autoLOC_316881 = <color=red>THROTTLE UP</color>
			#autoLOC_316899 = Final Descent Part 2
			#autoLOC_316907 = You're very close to the surface now! Slow down to only 5m/s (even slower when you can see your shadow) and land softly on the surface of another world!To make fine throttle adjustments easier, right-click on your engine and lower the thrust limiter down to 50 or so. That will make 100% on your throttle gauge only 50% throttle for the engine.
			#autoLOC_316912 = Altitude above terrain: <<1>> mVertical Speed: <<2>> m/sSpeed: <<3>> m/s <<4>>
			#autoLOC_316916 = <color=green>THROTTLE DOWN</color>
			#autoLOC_316917 = <color=red>THROTTLE UP</color>
			#autoLOC_316939 = Landed!
			#autoLOC_316949 = Congratulations! You've landed on the suface of the Mun!That's one small step for Val, one giant leap for Kerbalkind.
			#autoLOC_316950 = Next
			#autoLOC_316966 = Failure
			#autoLOC_316977 = Aw, shucks, something went terribly wrong here, you might want to try to stay alive when on an actual mission. Don't feel bad, you can try again another time.
			#autoLOC_316978 = Finish
			#autoLOC_317041 = To The Mun: Part 1
			#autoLOC_317049 = Welcome to the first in a series of lessons designed to prepare you for flight in and around Kerbin's local system.I've been inspired by that famous work of Jules Kerman, "From Kerbin to the Mun." We'll take a leaf out of his book, and go one better by returning as well!In our first lesson we will be starting from LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit) and travelling to the Mun, ending in Low Munar Orbit. I'm going to assume you've completed the flight tutorials preceding this as well as Orbiting 101, but if not, you really should go do them first.When you're ready to go, hit <color=<<1>>>Next</color>.
			#autoLOC_317050 = Next
			#autoLOC_317061 = Transfer Orbits
			#autoLOC_317070 = An important part of flights between celestial objects is a transfer orbit, which basically means an orbit used to change between two orbits. In our case, the periapsis of our orbit will be very near to Kerbin, and the apoapsis will extend to just beyond the Mun's orbit. Interplanetary trajectories are much the same, but on a much larger scale.Now, press the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key to go into the map view, so we can get an overview of Kerbin's local system.
			#autoLOC_317079 = Transfer Orbits
			#autoLOC_317087 = To perform a successful transfer, you'll need to arrange for your ship and the target to arrive at the same place at the same time. If you really know what you're doing you can calculate your own transfer orbit on the fly, or you could try eyeballing it. However, it's much easier to use maneuver nodes, so let's do that now.<color=<<1>>>Click</color> anywhere on your orbit, then click <color=<<2>>>Add Maneuver</color>.Do note that when playing a career-mode game, maneuver nodes will not be immediately available; you will have some facility upgrading to do before you have access to them.
			#autoLOC_317098 = Maneuver Nodes
			#autoLOC_317109 = Maneuver nodes let you plan orbital maneuvers ahead of time, and most importantly, you can do so without wasting precious propellant.As you can see, maneuver nodes have six handles: the green ones are prograde and retrograde, the purple ones normal and antinormal, and the blue ones are radial in and radial out.I'm not going to go into detail about these right now because these are the same vectors on the navball you saw in the Orbiting 101 tutorial. For now, just remember that prograde and retrograde help you grow or shrink your orbit, and normal and antinormal help you tilt it.
			#autoLOC_317110 = Next
			#autoLOC_317121 = Maneuver Nodes
			#autoLOC_317132 = You can click and drag the different handles to see how a burn made in that direction, for that duration, would affect the resultant orbit.In our particular case, we want to bring the apoapsis up just enough to intercept the Mun's orbit at a point around 45 degrees ahead of Mun's current position.If your trajectory is correct, the orbit line will shift colors when it gets close to Mun. This indicates the point where your ship will transition from the influence of Kerbin's gravity to that of the Mun. The region in which the pull from that body's gravity is strongest is its "Sphere of Influence", or SOI. (In real life the gravitational influence of all planets and moons matters too.)
			#autoLOC_317133 = Next
			#autoLOC_317144 = Maneuver Nodes
			#autoLOC_317154 = Let's get to it then! With the handles showing (you might need to click on the node to make them appear), pull the prograde handle until your post-maneuver orbit reaches as high as that of the Mun. But going that high is not enough to achieve an actual encounter. As I said before, timing also matters. So you may also need to move the node itself until you get an intercept (SOI change) with the Mun. You can do this by clicking on the inner circle of the node and dragging it forward or back along the line of your current orbital path.Don't forget that you can zoom the camera back to see a wider region of space, and if you want to start the burn planning over, you can delete the maneuver node and create a new one from scratch.To delete a node, right-click the manuever node while it's open and then click on the red delete icon. You can also click on the next-orbit or previous-orbit buttons, if you want to move the node forward or back in time by a whole orbit. Very useful if it gets behind you by mistake!
			#autoLOC_317160 = Next
			#autoLOC_317203 = Warp to Maneuver
			#autoLOC_317210 = There we go! You've planned a trans-munar injection maneuver; your post-maneuver orbit will enter the Mun's sphere of influence.There are a few things to notice now, so bring up your NavBall. You will find a few indicators and displays that weren't there before you added the maneuver node. (We saw these during the Go For Orbit tutorial, too, if you remember, but allow me to refresh your memory).The bar on the right is a graphical depiction of the velocity change (delta-V for short) required to perform the burn you've plotted. Below that you will also see the approximate time necessary to make the maneuver and deplete that graphical display of the burn. A new timer also counts down to the moment your ship will reach the maneuver node. We can speed up time to get to the burn position faster by clicking any point on the orbit beyond the maneuver node and then clicking warp to next maneuver. Do that now.If for some reason your maneuver node gets messed up, or you delete it, just re-plot a new one. Since it's only a plan/simulation of a burn, you haven't lost anything.
			#autoLOC_317246 = Maneuver Execution
			#autoLOC_317257 = We're getting close to maneuver time! There is one final step to take before performing the burn: you need to point your vessel down the planned vector, represented by the blue cross (or an arrow pointing to it).Once oriented you can worry about the burn. Here's an expert tip: look at the burn time estimate, halve it, and start your burn when the T-minus timer reads that number. If your burn time is 20 seconds, say, start burning at T-10s. This is because the maneuver node assumes an intantaneous burn, so if you average the burn around it it produces a more accurate orbit than if you only start burning at the time of the node so the average point is later.(Sometimes your estimated time will display N/A. An instant of full-thrust burn towards the manuever icon will reset this number without changing your current orbit enough to be a problem.)In our example, applying this tip means you should start your burn about when the countdown timer reads T-40 seconds.
			#autoLOC_317276 = Trans-Munar Injection Complete!
			#autoLOC_317284 = Good work! But you may have noticed your actual orbit is not exactly the one you had planned. This is because real burns are never instantaneous. However, close enough is good enough, as long as the trajectory markers are showing that we got a Mun encounter pretty close to the one we wanted.If you're not quite satisfied with your Munar intercept, you can still fine-tune it a bit by making small burns in various directions, but be careful not to overdo it. A counter-burn can undo a goof, but you still don't want to be wasting fuel.Now we'll wait for you to be sucked up by the Mun's gravity. But since that can take around six hours, you'll probably want to use the "warp here" trick like we used before, or plain old time warp, to shorten the wait. Try warping to just inside the Mun's SOI.
			#autoLOC_317299 = Munar Orbit Insertion
			#autoLOC_317313 = You are now in the Mun's sphere of influence, and Mun's is the only gravity affecting the motion of your ship. But you're on an escape trajectory relative to the Mun, which means that you are moving too quickly to orbit the Mun. If we didn't do anything, you'd whiz on past it and "escape." You will need to slow below escape velocity (burn retrograde) at periapsis in order to be "captured" and insert into Munar orbit. Remember the Orbit 101 tutorial: it's best to change your apoapsis at periapsis, and capturing is effectively changing your apoapsis from something far beyond Mun's SOI to a height that never leaves Mun's SOI, so we will perform that maneuver at periapsis.If your periapsis is hiding under the Mun's surface, that means you will crash unless you do something. You can fix this by creating a maneuver about half-way to the Mun (or even earlier), and then adjust either of the blue handles (radial in or radial out) to shift the periapsis to the altitude that you want it to be (say 50km). Execute that maneuver if necessary and we'll continue.
			#autoLOC_317316 = Next
			#autoLOC_317332 = Munar Orbit Insertion
			#autoLOC_317347 = We'll be using a maneuver node again to perform the capture burn and insert into munar orbit: add a node at periapsis. Once you've started to execute your capture burn and your velocity is a bit lower than escape (you have a reasonable munar apoapsis, and therefore are in orbit and unlikely to escape by an errant thruster fire), we'll proceed.
			#autoLOC_317351 = Current Eccentricity: <<1>> (Target: 0.8)
			#autoLOC_317355 = After Planned Manuever: None Found
			#autoLOC_317357 = After Planned Manuever: <<1>>
			#autoLOC_317372 = Munar Orbit Insertion
			#autoLOC_317381 = Now that you're not on an escape trajectory, try to get yourself into a reasonably circular orbit below at least <<1>>m.Remember, you can use yet another maneuver node. If your periapsis is also higher than <<2>>m, you'll need to lower your apoapsis first to make it your new periapsis, then burn at periapsis to lower the other end, too
			#autoLOC_317383 = Periapsis Altitude: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_317385 = Apoapsis Altitude: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_317387 = Eccentricity: <<1>>
			#autoLOC_317400 = Tutorial Complete!
			#autoLOC_317408 = Good work! You're now in a stable, circular orbit around the Mun with a ship fully capable of landing. Capable of landing, anyway, after you decouple the transfer stage so that it's not in the way. (See To The Mun Part 2 for a tutorial on landing).Today you've learnt how to use maneuver nodes to plan future orbits, set out to travel to another world, and parked in orbit around it. In our next lesson we'll cover the landing procedure, which I'm really looking forward to showing you.Landing on another body is a both exciting and terrifying experience, but for now I'm running late for lunch, so I will see you later.
			#autoLOC_317409 = Finish
			#autoLOC_317452 = Orbiting 101
			#autoLOC_317460 = Welcome to the Orbiting 101 training program! I'm <<1>>, and I'm going to teach you the basics of orbiting.I assume you've already done the basic flight tutorials, and are now ready to learn how to get around in space. If you haven't done them, well, I hope you know what you're doing.Let's get started.
			#autoLOC_317461 = Next
			#autoLOC_317472 = Orbiting 101 - Basics
			#autoLOC_317479 = Orbiting is really nothing more than free-falling. The only thing is that as you fall, you're moving so fast forward that you actually miss the ground. Because up here there is no atmosphere to slow you down at this height, you will continue to free-fall endlessly around the planet, without having to use your engines.We are currently on a low, almost circular orbit around Kerbin. To get a better view of your situation, press the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key to go into the Map View.
			#autoLOC_317487 = Orbiting 101 - The Map View
			#autoLOC_317494 = This is the map view. Here, you can see your ship's position and its current trajectory around the planet.Hold right-click and move the mouse to look around and see your orbit from various angles.Also, hovering over the icons on the map will display more information about them (and by right-clicking the node you will pin the info).Close the map when you're ready (press the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key again), so we can proceed.
			#autoLOC_317502 = Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS
			#autoLOC_317510 = Good. Let's get practical now. I trust you already know your basic spacecraft controls...Up here, they're very much the same, except that the lack of an atmosphere makes the ship behave quite a bit differently. Because there is no drag slowing you down, for every input you apply, you'll have to apply an opposite one to come to a stop again.I'm going to remotely nudge your attitude controls a little. Try to get the ship back under control afterwards.If you find yourself totally out of control, hit <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to toggle the S.A.S. on, and it will automatically cancel any remaining rotations.Are you ready?
			#autoLOC_317511 = Ready
			#autoLOC_317522 = Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS
			#autoLOC_317538 = Ok, here we go...
			#autoLOC_317542 = There! You are piloting now. Stop rotation using the pitch, yaw and roll controls.I suggest you use the navball to orient yourself instead of looking at the ship. The navball isn't affected by the camera rotation, so it should be easier to get your bearings through this instrument than by looking at the outside.
			#autoLOC_317563 = Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS
			#autoLOC_317570 = Nicely Done!Attitude control is an essential skill for a spacecraft pilot. Master it, and you'll be well on your way to becoming an expert pilot.You can try this again if you want, or press Next if you're ready to move on.
			#autoLOC_317571 = Try that again!
			#autoLOC_317576 = Next
			#autoLOC_317587 = Orbiting 101 - The NavBall
			#autoLOC_317594 = Let's have a look at the NavBall now. You've probably seen the symbols on it when you were spinning around. Here's what they mean:
			#autoLOC_317598 = Prograde and Retrograde Vectors: They point towards and away from your velocity vector respectively. That is, it points to and away from where you're going.
			#autoLOC_317603 = Radial in and out Vectors: They point towards and away from the currently orbited body.
			#autoLOC_317608 = Normal and Antinormal Vectors: They are perpendicular to the Orbital Plane, they point "upwards" and "downwards" with respect to the orbital plane respectively.
			#autoLOC_317611 = Next
			#autoLOC_317622 = Orbiting 101
			#autoLOC_317629 = Ok!Now, let's try something a little more involved. Open your map again.
			#autoLOC_317638 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317645 = What we want to do now is go through some of the basic maneuvers you'll need to know. Let's try raising your Apoapsis first.The Apoapsis is the highest point in an orbit, and it's indicated by the node marked [Ap].The best place to raise your apoapsis is at the Periapsis [Pe] node, which is the lowest point of your orbit. If you hover the mouse over Periapsis node, you'll see that we are going to reach it in a few minutes. Once there, we will face prograde and burn.Press <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> to speed up time a little, so we can get there faster.
			#autoLOC_317653 = Orbiting 101 - Time Warp
			#autoLOC_317660 = Ok, time is now passing <<1>> times faster than normal, so we should be there in a few moments.You can control time warp with the <color=<<2>>>[<<3>>]</color> and <color=<<4>>>[<<5>>]</color> keys, or click the arrows on the panel at the top left of the screen.This time, I'll put us back to normal time about a minute before we reach periapsis, and start lowering the rate even earlier.Outside of training, though, you'll have to warp time down to 1x yourself, so don't go too fast or you might miss your mark. You can also click on any given point on your orbit and click the Warp Here option. The ship's systems will automatically warp time as fast as possible to get you there.
			#autoLOC_317679 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317686 = Ok, we are a few seconds away from periapsis now. Time to turn prograde and do our burn.However, instead of closing the map, let's just bring up the navball here, so we can see what's happening to our orbit as we accelerate.To bring up the navball on the map, click the little tab on the bottom-center of the screen, or press the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key.Oh, and if you activate your S.A.S. with <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> you will see shortcuts to the different autopiloting vectors next to the navball. If you don't feel like maneuvering yourself right now, just click the <color=<<5>>>Orbit Prograde</color> icon.
			#autoLOC_317694 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317701 = Good. Time to do our burn. Turn the ship to face the Prograde Vector now.Remember that you can just activate the Stability Assist (<color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key) and click the Orbit Prograde button next to the NavBall and the ships Pilot (or Probe Core) will do it for you.
			#autoLOC_317703 = Remember, the prograde vector looks like this:
			#autoLOC_317706 = Make sure the ship is pointing towards it before accelerating.
			#autoLOC_317715 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317725 = Ok, we are now turned prograde. Check SAS is engaged for you to keep her steady. Press the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> key to accelerate at full throttle.
			#autoLOC_317733 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317740 = Notice how the opposite side of your orbit starts to rise as you accelerate?Keep thrusting prograde until your apoapsis altitude reaches about 800,000m.
			#autoLOC_317743 = Apoapsis Altitude: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_317753 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317767 = Ok, cut the throttle now!Hold <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> or hit <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> to cut throttle immediately.
			#autoLOC_317775 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317782 = Well Done!This is how you raise your Apoapsis node.With orbital maneuvers, pretty much everything you do will affect the opposite side of your orbit. So to raise the highest point (Apoapsis), you thrust forward (or prograde) at the lowest point (Periapsis). Similarly, to raise your Periapsis, you thrust prograde at Apoapsis. We're on our way to the Apoapsis now, so let's do just that.Press <color=<<1>>>Next</color> when ready, and I'll warp time to get us there quickly
			#autoLOC_317783 = Next
			#autoLOC_317795 = Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers
			#autoLOC_317803 = Ok, we're on our way to the apoapsis node now. Notice how your ship loses speed as we rise. That's because we're climbing away from the planet, so we lose speed as we go higher, just like a ball does when thrown into the air back on Kerbin. The higher you are, the slower your orbit will be. Notice how the Mun's orbital speed is around 540m/s (you can see this by hovering over the Mun's marker), while yours is far higher? That's because our orbit is so much lower than that of the Mun. When we reach apoapsis, we will burn prograde again, to raise the periapsis node and circularize our orbit.
			#autoLOC_317822 = Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis
			#autoLOC_317829 = Ok, here we are. Same as before: turn your ship to face prograde.Mind that we are probably facing the other way right now, so the prograde marker might not be visible at first. But you can find it easily because it's on the opposite side from the retrograde marker. Once you're facing the right direction, fire up that engine and watch the periapsis rise.
			#autoLOC_317837 = Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis
			#autoLOC_317844 = Keep burning prograde until the orbit is nearly circular. Eccentricity will be 0 when it's perfectly circular, so keep an eye on that (Eccentricity measures how elliptical your orbit is; 0 means the orbit is circular).
			#autoLOC_317847 = Periapsis Altitude: <<1>>
			#autoLOC_317856 = Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis
			#autoLOC_317870 = Nicely done!This is how you change the size of your orbit. This maneuver should come in handy in many situations.Next, we'll look into changing your orbital inclination.Press <color=<<1>>>Next</color> when ready to proceed.
			#autoLOC_317871 = Next
			#autoLOC_317882 = Orbiting 101 - Inclination
			#autoLOC_317889 = Your orbital inclination is the angle between your orbit and Kerbin's equator. If you've managed to maintain a reasonable amount of control so far, we should still be in a nearly 0° inclination orbit. That is, even though we've changed the altitude of our orbit, it still has the same inclination as before.Changing inclination is done by thrusting at a 90 degree angle to your prograde vector, but without changing your pitch relative to the surface.On our present, nearly equatorial orbit, prograde is due east. That means to increase our inclination, so that our orbit takes us into higher latitudes, we have to burn towards the normal direction.
			#autoLOC_317890 = Next
			#autoLOC_317901 = Orbiting 101 - Normal Vectors
			#autoLOC_317908 = If all that I just said made your head spin, the navball once again comes to your rescue. In this case, you will need to use the normal vector to change your orbital inclination. Let's try that now; turn the ship to the normal vector's direction and open the throttle.
			#autoLOC_317910 = Normal Vector:
			#autoLOC_317921 = Orbiting 101 - Inclination
			#autoLOC_317928 = Notice how as you burn north, your orbit starts to tilt up on one side, but the periapsis and apoapsis nodes remain mostly the same? That is because we are accelerating on a completely new direction, so this maneuver doesn't add or take away any energy from the orbit, as long as we are careful to continue facing normal during the burn.Keep accelerating towards the normal until your inclination is about 10°.
			#autoLOC_317931 = Orbit Inclination:<<1>>°
			#autoLOC_317940 = Orbiting 101 - Inclination
			#autoLOC_317954 = Good! This is how you change your orbital inclination.For these maneuvers, it's always better to do it in the slowest parts of the orbit so you don't have to spend as much delta-V to turn your orbit around. That also means inclination changes on larger orbits, such as we are on now, take less fuel than the same inclination change on a lower orbit.Also, keep in mind that changing inclination doesn't necessarily mean accelerating to the north or south. It means accelerating at right angles to your prograde vector, which on our nearly equatorial orbit, also happened to be towards the north.Next, let's look into the last essential maneuver you'll need to learn: lowering our orbit.
			#autoLOC_317955 = Next
			#autoLOC_317966 = Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis
			#autoLOC_317973 = As you can imagine, lowering your orbit's altitude is very much like raising it, only in reverse.Because there's no air up here, we can use our main engines to decelerate as well as accelerate, because the ship's orientation will not cause problems with airflow and flying backwards is easy as flying forwards.Also, since our orbit is nearly circular, we can just turn retrograde and do our burn at any time now, so let's get to it.Turn toward the retrograde vector and start that engine up again.
			#autoLOC_317975 = Retrograde Vector:
			#autoLOC_317985 = Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis
			#autoLOC_317992 = Keep burning retrograde until the periapsis altitude is around 20,000m.Try getting it as close as possible this time. If you overshoot and make it too low, turn prograde and accelerate a little to bring it back up. For precision, remember that you can fine tune your throttle using the <color=<<1>>>[<<2>>]</color> and <color=<<3>>>[<<4>>]</color> keys.
			#autoLOC_317995 = Periapsis Altitude: <<1>>m
			#autoLOC_318004 = Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis
			#autoLOC_318011 = That's it! You're now on your way back.20,000m is low enough to hit the atmosphere, so you are now on a re-entry course to Kerbin. Once we're below 60,000m, the atmosphere will start slowing the ship down to the point that it won't have enough velocity to rise back up again.
			#autoLOC_318012 = Next
			#autoLOC_318023 = Orbiting 101 - Complete!
			#autoLOC_318031 = This is all we need to do for this lesson. You could keep playing and either perform more maneuvers or ride this path down to a landing, or you could skip to the next lesson. If you do try for a landing, don't forget to decouple the capsule and deploy the parachutes.See you on the ground!
			#autoLOC_318032 = Finish
			#autoLOC_318504 = Science
			#autoLOC_318512 = Hello and welcome to today's lecture on the Kerbal scientific method. I am <<1>>, scientist extraordinaire. This tutorial doesn't really require any previous knowledge, but in order to gather science points you will have to acquaint yourself with almost every aspect of the game, so you should do them all at some point.We are now at the Kerbal Space Center. For a tour, see the Basic Construction tutorial. For now we'll focus on the Research and Development Complex.
			#autoLOC_318513 = Next
			#autoLOC_318525 = Research and Development Complex
			#autoLOC_318533 = The large complex nearest to you is the Research and Development Complex. This is where you will make use of the science points your missions award you to unlock more parts.Go ahead and click on it to see it in action.
			#autoLOC_318545 = Inside the RnD Complex
			#autoLOC_318553 = Very good! What you see in the middle of the graph paper background is the Tech Tree. It shows how far your research has taken Kerbal technology.You don't have much to show right now, because you're not a world-class scientist like myself. At least not yet. But I trust you have the potential to achieve great things.
			#autoLOC_318554 = Next
			#autoLOC_318566 = Unlock a Node
			#autoLOC_318575 = In a typical career game, you will start with a few parts and have to earn the rest.For education's sake, I've gone ahead and given some data units to your space program, so you should have enough science to unlock the next node. The total of your current available science points is shown on the top right.Let's get cracking. Select any of the available grayed out nodes and <color=<<1>>>click</color> the blue <color=<<2>>>Research</color> button on the right pane. Some of your science points will be spent to buy that invention.
			#autoLOC_318587 = Node Unlocked
			#autoLOC_318595 = Hooray! That's how research is done. You may have noticed that additional nodes were linked to the one you just researched, and are now available to be researched as well.Don't know what to pick next? Don't worry; you can select a node at any time and useful information will be displayed in the right pane. This includes the new parts that it contains, and how much science is needed to research it.
			#autoLOC_318596 = Next
			#autoLOC_318608 = Where Does it Come From?
			#autoLOC_318615 = Now, you're probably thinking to yourself, "This is all nice and jolly, but how do I get more science?"You can get more by doing many things, such as gathering crew reports from regions your Kerbals visit, fulfilling some kinds of contracts, collecting samples from various locations, equipping your ships with parts for experiments (such as the Mystery Goo Containment Unit) and using them, etc. There are many possibilities, really.Most of these actions are performed through "context menus" which are displayed when you right-click on various parts, and sometimes on Kerbals. Just keep in mind that your mission needs to transmit the results or survive a physical return to Kerbin in order for the raw data points to be converted into useful science.
			#autoLOC_318616 = Next
			#autoLOC_318628 = Progress
			#autoLOC_318636 = All of the activities I mentioned, and the many others you can discover, are tracked in a record for future reference. You can access these Science Archives by clicking the yellow button on the upper left. Well, what are you waiting for? <color=<<1>>>Click</color> it!
			#autoLOC_318654 = Science Archives
			#autoLOC_318678 = That's it! The first and most important thing to notice is the rugged good looks of this fellow in charge. You can also see which science activities you have already performed, when, with whom and how much science they earned for you.This is important, because you see, if you repeat the same experiment multiple times, its scientific value diminishes, because you already knew part of the answer.Mind you, as a result you will receive less science each time you repeat an action, until you get practically nothing for it all anymore.
			#autoLOC_318679 = Next
			#autoLOC_318711 = Science Archives
			#autoLOC_318719 = Another outstanding feature of the archives is that you can check which celestial bodies you have already visited and conducted experiments on or around.You can do so by clicking the icon corresponding to the body that you're interested in.For now, you will only see the records of the research I gave you, but once you start doing your own science, you will be able to check it here.
			#autoLOC_318720 = Next
			#autoLOC_318732 = Conclusion
			#autoLOC_318740 = That covers the basics of science.This is a theoretical class, and I'm sure it will all make a lot more sense when you go out and try it yourself.Remember that science requires curiosity, so go out and experiment. And don't be discouraged if a mission doesn't go quite as planned; if you learn something new, it's not a complete failure.If you're still feeling lost, feel free to try the other tutorials. I'm looking forward to your accomplishments.I must continue my own research now. When you're done, show yourself out by using the red <color=<<1>>>Leave</color> button on the upper right.

			#autoLOC_500000 = Why go up when you can crash equally well going sideways – that’s the old moto of the C7 Aerospace Division. Emerging from humble beginnings to the powerhouse they are now, C7 were always looking straight ahead towards the horizon. Recently though they have been building parts that can give them a much better view of that spot where the sky meets the ground. This has been met with some grumblings from the old boys in the company but even they can’t deny that there is adventure to be found in whatever direction you choose.
			#autoLOC_500001 = Dinkelstein Kerman has become somewhat of a legend in the spacecraft industry, not least impressively because he vehemently claims to have been constructing and flying spaceships long before the first actual recorded instance of any such vehicle being assembled. This has led to some controversy and a lot of awkwardness between him and the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society. Be that as it may, Dinklestein's Emporium is still generally well regarded as a traditional, old-fashioned company, and their products are actually a lot less rusty than the company's owner.
			#autoLOC_500002 = The Experimental Engineering Group is a typical startup company: Low budgets and impossibly tight deadlines are part of a normal working day for them. Despite being such a young company however, Experimental Engineering has made a good start, quickly making a name for themselves in the industry, mainly thanks to their very educational and entertaining SC-9001 Science Jr. Experiment Kit. Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.
			#autoLOC_500003 = FLOOYD Labs is a company focused on doing one thing, and doing it as well as is conceivably possible to do it: Displacing liquids from one place to another. Their flagship product, the FTX-2 Fuel Duct, is the final result of years of research and development and endless Kerbal-hours of effort to produce a device that will pump any amount of just about anything, no matter how cold, dense or volatile it is. The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.
			#autoLOC_500004 = Goliath National Products know what’s needed to keep them ahead of the competition – an eye for detail and a good nose for sniffing out what’s needed for our plucky engineers. Many of the great Vessels of our age carry one of Goliaths nose cones and they excel in moving air out of the way of the soft fleshy important bits of any Vessel i.e. our heroes heading off on another adventure.
			#autoLOC_500005 = What this small company lacks in experience and reputation, it makes up for in the sheer ambitiousness of their projects. Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.
			#autoLOC_500006 = One of the leading names in spacecraft electronics, and not just because the name itself sounds so cool. Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics has a large catalogue of components, ranging from simple comms devices to seriously cutting edge gear. This has made their products quite popular among aerospace engineers, and also nurtured a profound enmity from the pragmatic folks at Probodobodyne.
			#autoLOC_500007 = It is universally agreed that Jeb's Junkyard is one the best examples of the triumph of unwavering motivation in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The unassuming junkyard where it is said some of Kerbalkind's first steps towards the depths of space have been taken, has now become a much larger junkyard, as it had to expand its facilities to accommodate the ever greater demand for spacecraft components. Jeb's Junkyard has become one of Kerbin's most iconic names, becoming far more than just a beloved brand. It now stands proudly as a symbol of the unstoppable Kerbal drive towards attempting the impossible while grossly underestimating the gravity of the situation.
			#autoLOC_500008 = Kerbal Motion LLC started in the wheel business with square wheels initially. They began adding sides until they settled on a more spherical configuration. Intensive testing confirmed their suspicions that round wheels really do make for a much smoother ride. Once they had overcome this hurdle the brains at Kerbal Motion LLC then began looking towards what else they could apply their considerable grey matter to. They settled on grabbers, primarily as this would mean they wouldn’t have to reach quite so far for their drinks.
			#autoLOC_500009 = An institution completely devoted to the tracking and curating all first instances of any event, the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society is a  non-profit organization, for the purpose of rewarding the doing of anything that's never been done before, especially concerning feats of space exploration. Their work is more challenging than it would seem however, as the prestige associated with the first-ever accomplishment of any deed is also a valuable target for commercial companies, who wouldn't waste the opportunity to be the official sponsor of such an event. Taking on the Society's contracts will definitely send the message that you're not in it for the money, which is always a good message to send. It's also just about the only reward, since the cash prizes are mostly symbolic.
			#autoLOC_500010 = Although Kerbodyne is a relatively new name in the aerospace industry, their K series engines and fuel tanks have earned them a quite a reputation in a short amount of time. So much so in fact, that Kerbodyne was nominated for the "Best Debut" Award, at last year's Spacecraft Developers Convention. Unfortunately, that prize went to another company, but Kerbodyne fans are known to demonstrate loudly and publicly, their appreciation for the company and its products.
			#autoLOC_500011 = Kerlington has a long history of introducing ground-breaking new technologies, many of which are now considered indispensable for rocketry and aerospace engineering. This has fostered a strong community of loyal Kerlington fans, as well as a similarly large group of disgruntled competitors.
			#autoLOC_500012 = The Maxo Construction Toys engineers always enjoyed building things – especially out of little plastic bricks. So when they put their heads together and got a bit of money in the bank they decided to do the same but with bits of lightweight metal. Maxo’s metallic constructions are renowned for their durability and build quality. In fact when sifting through the wreckage of yet another spectacular “landing”, their parts are almost always found intact.
			#autoLOC_500013 = The Moving Parts Experts Group started off as a mostly non-commercial initiative to bring some of the brightest minds together to create truly innovative and ground-breaking technologies for spacecraft construction. As is the case with many such enterprises, their initial investment funds very soon ran out and they were forced to start developing stuff that they could sell, quickly. As a result, the Group acquired a reputation for being always in a hurry, and always strapped for cash. They still try their best to stay true to their original motivations as much as possible though, and will always be willing to support any ventures that push the currently established boundaries.
			#autoLOC_500014 = For a company that made a reputation by creating as much destruction as possible, O.M.B. has found a remarkably suitable place for its highly volatile devices in the aerospace industry. Their precision Decouplers are second to none when the job calls for splitting spacecraft into multiple smaller ones. Some of their other demolition products however, despite being heavily advertised as far more powerful disassembly tools, weren't nearly as successful. O.M.B. is still unsure as to why those "clearly better" products weren't so well received.
			#autoLOC_500015 = Periapsis Rocket Supplies are a notoriously private company – the small roster of components they do build does nothing but add to the mystique surrounding them. Many question why they don’t build more parts but Periapsis responds to this by stating “wait and see what we’ll do next!”. However, this has been the standard response for at least 3 generations so many have been waiting a little while for the answer.
			#autoLOC_500016 = Probodobodyne was at one point one of the leading (and few) names in the industry. Over the years though, the company has fallen behind the times somewhat, but they continue to maintain their philosophy that space exploration should be the privilege of the few who can overcome the challenges of conquering it, with minimal technological assistance. Their products reflect that pragmatic and arguably obsolete outlook, even in spite of the many newer companies that are coming up around them with alternatives that make space travel far more accessible than it was back in the "early days". Despite all this, the company has retained a small but loyal following of hardcore fans, who live by their vision of a very selective industry, populated only by the very best astronauts and engineers.
			#autoLOC_500017 = The Space Program's own Research & Development Department. Headed by celebrity rocket scientist Wernher von Kerman, these guys are the brains of the whole operation. Driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, no piece of data is too small or too irrelevant, and increasing the accumulated knowledge of Kerbalkind is their main motivation. Our resident geniuses only ask to be given due academic credit for their contributions to science, and that all astronauts PLEASE refrain from entering the labs without cleaning their boots first.
			#autoLOC_500018 = Reaction Systems is a small company, which enjoyed a reasonable amount of success with their one successful product, the Place-Anywhere Linear RCS Port. These days, nobody knows for certain what they're working on. Even though Reaction Systems is most definitely not the largest company out there, they try to make up for it by supporting all pioneering endeavours. Also, their eagerness to offer science-gathering contracts lends credit to speculation that they may be up to something.
			#autoLOC_500019 = Indisputably the largest supplier of rocketry components out there, Rockomax products are widely regarded as the most accessible way to get into space. This has earned them a somewhat negative reputation among the more posh or avant-garde engineers, some even outright refusing to admit to having used Rockomax-Brand products. Be that as it may, Rockomax's gigantic presence in the industry cannot be gainsaid, and their products are actually pretty good value, even if they do lack that 'trendy' feel of the more up-scale rocketry brands. They are a massively large corporation, so don't expect them to cut you very special deals. They are already giving all their customers a bulk discount, plus their 'super-value' deals when using products from their partner brands. All this provided, of course, that you have your membership card with you when you go shopping at their warehouses.
			#autoLOC_500020 = Rokea is mainly known for their 'vertical mobility enhancer' products, which they go to great lengths to ensure are not mistaken by simplistic 'ladders'. Some say they are failing miserably in that effort, even though every Rokea representative will very eagerly educate all who come within earshot about the differences between ladders and a vertical mobility enhancement device. Perhaps this communications strategy is part of the reason nobody cares.
			#autoLOC_500021 = Many question the reasoning behind Sean's Cannery's -known for their very excellent canned foods products- incursion into the aerospace engineering world. Despite the criticism, none can dispute that their flagship product, the Mk2 Lander Can, has proven itself many times over as a reliable and perhaps not surprisingly, one of the most air-tight crew carrying modules available today. Lander Can crews often praise the module for its ability to keep stowed snacks crisp and fresh, and complain of how on other pods they become mushy after just a few days into the mission.
			#autoLOC_500022 = STEADLER is not known for being a very kind or yielding company. Rather, militaristic, stern and uncompromising are much more fitting adjectives to describe them. Some say these are good qualities for a company responsible mainly for engineering control systems for rockets and hypersonic aircraft, while others suggest that the company is actually being run by a rogue Guidance Module that achieved sentience. All we really know is that their gate security is much too Temperamental to allow for any observation, and that their stun guns recharge very quickly.
			#autoLOC_500023 = One of the largest manufacturers of structural components for any purpose, StrutCo is by all measures a very well-established company. The only thing they have never been able to get over is the fact that the legendary EAS-4 Strut Connector itself was actually invented by Kerlington Model Rockets.
			#autoLOC_500024 = Vac-Co is a relatively new name in the industry. With previous experience only as a manufacturer of housecleaning equipment and small appliances, their recent venture into aerospace engineering has been met with no small amount of skepticism. Nevertheless, they seem to know what they're doing, as their products have been quite innovative in the air intakes for spaceplanes sector.
			#autoLOC_500025 = WinterOwl is by no means comparable to other large aircraft companies in terms of sheer number of products they offer. However, the company is one of the best-known names in the industry as it's one of the oldest companies in operation. This has earned them a reputation for being a friendly, reliable partner, which means they have good standings with many other companies. In the aerospace circles, it is considered very poor manners to be rude about WinterOwl or its products.
			#autoLOC_500026 = Zaltonics isn't exactly known as a strong leader in the electronic components industry, rather more as a somewhat utilitarian company that lacks a certain amount of ambition. These traits however, have made Zaltonic indispensable in their own way, as they are willing to take on the manufacturing of the less exciting devices, and they've become quite good at doing that in a quick and cost-effective way. Their products might not be all the rage, but when your fancy remote guidance unit runs out of juice, chances are you'll be using a Zaltonics battery to keep it powered.

The discovery led to the invention of the Aerodynamically Integrated Retrograde Braking Robustly Armed Kinetic Extending System (A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.), which is now popular mostly as a cheap alternative to longer runways.

			#autoLOC_500286 = Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large
			#autoLOC_500287 = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

			#autoLOC_500338 = QBE is Probodobodyne's latest development in probe miniaturization. Despite it's diminutive size, the QBE is a fully-functional and incredibly lightweight command unit. All this goodness comes at a price however: The QBE's tiny enclosure means there is no room for internal reaction wheels, and battery capacity is pitiful at best. Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and relay control input from the ground to the craft, it carries no crew at all, thus keeping them perfectly safe from all harm. This device does require electricity to operate however, and will cease to function if the power runs out. The built-in batteries should keep it going for about 10 minutes.

			#autoLOC_500361 = FTX-2 External Fuel Duct
			#autoLOC_500362 = New breakthroughs at FLOOYD Dynamics have made the FTX Fuel Duct a reality. Altough criticized by some as being no more than 'a sewage pipe painted yellow', most agree that the yellow is a relatively nice color, and that fuel lines are indeed able to pump fuel from side-mounted fuel tanks. After the recall of the FTX-1 series, All FTX-2 lines have arrows painted on to indicate the fuel flow direction, so engineers can tell which way around they are supposed to go.

			#autoLOC_500442 = LV-T45 "Swivel" Liquid Fuel Engine
			#autoLOC_500443 = The LV-T45 engine was considered a breakthrough in the LV-T series due to its Thrust Vectoring feature. The LV-T45 can deflect its thrust to aid in craft control. All these added mechanics however, make for a slightly smaller and heavier engine in comparison with other LV-T models.

			#autoLOC_500458 = Kerbodyne's flagship engine, the KS-25 excels as a first stage engine through its high thrust-to-weight ratio and exceptional sea level efficiency. Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

This made most employees at Reaction Systems Ltd feel quite awkward, as they were particularly proud of having delivered this project on schedule for once. This Engine responds to main throttle controls, but it consumes MonoPropellant instead of a Fuel+Oxidizer mix.

			#autoLOC_500472 = LFB KR-1x2 "Twin-Boar" Liquid Fuel Engine
			#autoLOC_500473 = This liquid fuel booster system is a very purposeful piece of engineering. Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

			#autoLOC_500475 = Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" Liquid Fuel Engine
			#autoLOC_500476 = This engine is Kerbodyne's first attempt at a highly advanced engine. The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

			#autoLOC_500479 = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

			#autoLOC_500486 = (hammer moar (more motor rocket srb
			#autoLOC_500487 = RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster
			#autoLOC_500488 = While considered by some to be little more than "a trash bin full o' boom", The RT-5 can be seen in use at many space programs, perhaps possibly because it is the only option for many space programs, but nevertheless, this small booster provides a nice kick to lift small payloads to considerable heights. Use with caution, though. Once lit, solid fuel motors cannot be put out until the fuel runs out.

These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.

			#autoLOC_500529 = FL-T200 Fuel Tank
			#autoLOC_500530 = The T200 tank had some difficulty being accepted in the spacecraft engineering world, because most rocket builders had trouble overcoming their urges to squee at the "cute little fuel tank". This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers". The T200 Tank now is widely used in several space programs and does a remarkably good job, if assembled politely.
			#autoLOC_500531 = fueltank ?lfo liquid oxidizer propellant rocket
			#autoLOC_500532 = FL-T400 Fuel Tank
			#autoLOC_500533 = The FL series was received as a substantial upgrade over previous fuel containers used in the Space Program, generally due to its ability to keep the fuel unexploded more often than not. Fuel tanks are useless if there isn't a Liquid Engine attached under it. They can also be stacked with other fuel tanks to increase the amount of fuel for the engine below.

			#autoLOC_500535 = FL-T800 Fuel Tank

			#autoLOC_500733 = Mk1 Diverterless Supersonic Intake
			#autoLOC_500734 = This version of the Mk1 Fuselage module carries only a bit of fuel, but is fitted with a streamlined air intake. It consists of a "bump" and a forward-swept inlet cowl. This eliminates the need for a Splitter plate, while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic to subsonic speeds.

			#autoLOC_500826 = TR-2C Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_500827 = Similarly to the TR-18D, the TR-2C is a utility for slicing a rocket into two halves, but now in a more compact size. The manual says the explosive content is just enough to eject anything attached to the unit in a safe, controlled manner. The delivery guy did have a full bomb suit on though, so try not to drop it.
			#autoLOC_500828 = break decouple separat split stag
			#autoLOC_500829 = TR-XL Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_500830 = The TR-XL Stack Separator is the largest available from O.M.B, designed for slicing the largest of rockets in twain. Unlike Decouplers, Separators will eject anything connected to themselves. This is good, as it removes the need to worry about which side needs to be pointed away from face. Try to not look at it too much though.
			#autoLOC_500831 = break decouple separat split stag
			#autoLOC_500832 = Rockomax Brand Decoupler

			#autoLOC_500849 = Inline Clamp-O-Tron
			#autoLOC_500850 = The Inline Clamp-O-Tron was an accidental invention, created after an engineer (who really should have been wearing his glasses) incorrectly interpreted the Shielded Clamp-O-Tron's blueprints. Still, the rest of the team very much liked the idea of a sideways-pointing docking port with its own aerodynamic shell, so he patented the design. He still refuses to admit it wasn't intentional.

			#autoLOC_500852 = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port Jr.
			#autoLOC_500853 = Originally marketed as a child-size version of the normal Clamp-O-Tron, the Clamp-O-Tron Jr. soon found use among hobbyists and professional space agencies alike for its compact profile, lightweight structure, and all-round cuteness. As a result of its small size, kerbals need to hold their breath and wiggle to slip through.

			#autoLOC_500855 = Clamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port
			#autoLOC_500856 = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels.

			#autoLOC_500861 = Advanced Grabbing Unit
			#autoLOC_500862 = Kerbal Motion engineers have long struggled with the problem of how to extract dropped tools from complicated machinery. After observing an intern cleaning out his shoes by turning them upside and shaking them inside the lab, our team was hit with a stroke of inspiration! Why not turn the rocket parts upside down and shake them? The grabbing arm perfectly filled this niche, and is quite capable of lifting heavy machinery. It has since found other uses, besides delicate tool extraction operations. AKA "The Klaw!"

			#autoLOC_500889 = The TT18-A Stability Enhancer uses ground-breaking fastening technology to significantly increase the stability of spacecraft during the pre-launch phase. While OMB Demolition has been criticized in the past for using "big fancy words for a rocket holder" in their description of their device, none can say the TT18 series doesn't deliver rock-solid clamping action, as advertised. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.

			#autoLOC_500954 = Illuminator Mk1
			#autoLOC_500955 = The Illuminator Mk1 from RKEA projects a strong beam of photons in its prograde direction, increasing the brightness of surfaces exposed to the beam (it's a big flashlight).
			#autoLOC_500956 = moar (more bulb candle dark flash (lamp (light shine spot torch
			#autoLOC_500957 = Illuminator Mk2
			#autoLOC_500958 = The Illuminator Mk2 is an extra-wide beam, low-power Illuminator, for lighting up large swaths of whatever you wish. However, its beam does not shine very far.
			#autoLOC_500959 = moar (more bulb candle dark flash flood (lamp (light shine torch
			#autoLOC_500960 = TVR-200 Stack Bi-Coupler
			#autoLOC_500961 = The TVR-200 Stack Bi-Coupler is a simple method for splitting one rocket into two - WITHOUT the disastrous consequences of doing it the normal (explosive) way.
			#autoLOC_500962 = dual mount multi pair split twin two
			#autoLOC_500963 = TVR-2160C Mk2 Stack Quad-Coupler
			#autoLOC_500964 = What could be more awesome than a Tricoupler? Why, a quadcoupler, of course. Just remember that this is not a decoupler, and will not separate stages.
			#autoLOC_500965 = ?4 four mount multi (quad split
			#autoLOC_500966 = TVR-1180C Mk1 Stack Tri-Coupler
			#autoLOC_500967 = The Stack Tricoupler! If your stack is lacking in awesomeness, this is the tool for you! Just remember that this is not a decoupler, and won't separate stages.

			#autoLOC_500975 = LY-05 Steerable Landing Gear
			#autoLOC_500976 = Simple wheel with steering actuation. It has become evident that aerodynamic control surfaces don't offer much control while slowly taxiing on the ground. Hopefully these wheels will reduce the number of low altitude low speed collisions with buildings. And Kerbals.

			#autoLOC_500996 = RoveMax Model XL3
			#autoLOC_500997 = The RoveMax Model 3 was developed in total secrecy by Kerbal Motion's R&D team over the course of a year and a half. When it was finally revealed to the company's chairman, he stared in shock, screamed 'WHY', and subsequently dropped dead on the spot.

			#autoLOC_501082 = Specialized Construction
			#autoLOC_501083 = Specialized construction techniques provide new ways of attaching things together, and detaching things on purpose.
			#autoLOC_501084 = Precision Propulsion

			#autoLOC_501086 = Advanced Aerodynamics
			#autoLOC_501087 = Advances in fluid dynamics research technology have allowed development of a new set of streamlined aircraft components, And also these parts here.
			#autoLOC_501088 = Heavy Landing

			#autoLOC_501092 = Unmanned Tech
			#autoLOC_501093 = Warning: May contain traces of sentience.
			#autoLOC_501094 = Nuclear Propulsion
			#autoLOC_501095 = Nuclear engines don't burn fuel, they totally annihilate it. We just hope it doesn't begin any conflicts.
			#autoLOC_501096 = Advanced MetalWorks
			#autoLOC_501097 = These new construction techniques allow for craft designs that were considered insane not too long ago... and still are. But they're now possible!
			#autoLOC_501098 = Field Science
			#autoLOC_501099 = Freedom to roam as far as curiosity will take you, or as long as batteries last.
			#autoLOC_501100 = High Altitude Flight
			#autoLOC_501101 = New breakthroughs in engine and intake development to enable flying through the upper reaches of the atmosphere.

			#autoLOC_501116 = Nanolathing

			#autoLOC_501119 = Improvements in remote control technology for a new generation of probe designs.
			#autoLOC_501120 = Meta-Materials

			#autoLOC_501122 = Very Heavy Rocketry
			#autoLOC_501123 = While ever-larger rockets may not be the answer every time, for all other times, we've developed these.
			#autoLOC_501124 = Advanced Science Tech
			#autoLOC_501125 = Scientific advancements allow new advanced technologies for advancing Science.
			#autoLOC_501126 = Advanced Motors
			#autoLOC_501127 = Wheel technology is just rolling along now. You could even say our engineers are on a roll with it.
			#autoLOC_501128 = Specialized Electrics
			#autoLOC_501129 = Experience the warm glow of the latest in electrical technology. Figuratively, of course, and maybe also quite literally as well. Actually, try to avoid direct exposure.
			#autoLOC_501130 = High-Performance Fuel Systems
			#autoLOC_501131 = Massive engines require massive fuel storage solutions.
			#autoLOC_501132 = Experimental Aerodynamics
			#autoLOC_501133 = Winged flight technology is soaring to unprecedented heights. It could even be said that it's properly taking off now.
			#autoLOC_501134 = Automation
			#autoLOC_501135 = We can't think of anything that could go wrong with letting an experimental AI handle every aspect of a mission.
			#autoLOC_501136 = Aerospace Tech
			#autoLOC_501137 = The absolute cutting-edge in aerospace technology. Quite literally, some of those edges are very sharp. Handle with care.
			#autoLOC_501138 = Large Probes
			#autoLOC_501139 = The rumours of probe-led world domination are greatly exaggerated.
			#autoLOC_501140 = Experimental Science
			#autoLOC_501141 = Explore novel fields of science that we didn't even know were there.
			#autoLOC_501142 = Experimental Motors
			#autoLOC_501143 = The latest breakthroughs that are driving motor technology forwards, and in reverse, and steering too.
			#autoLOC_501144 = Experimental Electrics
			#autoLOC_501145 = The very latest in electrical systems technology. Our engineers are buzzing with excitement over it. They also seem to glow in the dark now. Fascinating!
			#autoLOC_501146 = He's an accountant, called Mortimer. He doesn't have many friends, but he likes things to be under control and arranged in right angles. This job is pretty stressful for him.
			#autoLOC_501147 = Linus is Wernher Von Kerman's Intern. Because Wernher himself is too important to be bothered with these boring strategy meetings. He sends his intern in his stead.
			#autoLOC_501148 = Walt Kerman is the spokesperson for the Space Program. He wears a hazmat suit. Which isn't strictly required for his job, but it seems appropriate for someone working in such a toxic environment.
			#autoLOC_501149 = Gus Kerman is head of Space Program Operations and all-around repairs guy whenever something around here breaks down, and he's the reason why all our pods have windows.
			#autoLOC_501150 = Appreciation Campaign
			#autoLOC_501151 = We could definitely improve our image by putting some effort into reminding Kerbals everywhere of just how great the Space Program is. Advertisement space isn't free, however.
			#autoLOC_501152 = Fundraising Campaign
			#autoLOC_501153 = We can likely raise some money by exploiting the attention that we get out of new successful ventures to remind the well-to-do Kerbals out there that we could use their support, and the contents of their wallets. This is probably going to be seen as a bit cheeky of us, so be prepared to face some backlash from the public.
			#autoLOC_501154 = Open-Source Tech Program
			#autoLOC_501155 = Even though we went through great lengths to get our scientific data, making it available for free to all of Kerbalkind can only be seen as a good thing. R&D will probably not be at its peak efficiency however, with all the noise these outside opinions tend to generate.
			#autoLOC_501156 = Unpaid Research Program
			#autoLOC_501157 = A program where undergrad researchers are given the opportunity to work in our great Space Program, to boost the science earned out of each mit of data. The Interns don't get paid, but the prestige of working with such a grand organization as ours surely is its own reward, isn't it?
			#autoLOC_501158 = Outsourced R&D
			#autoLOC_501159 = Why do all the data-crunching ourselves when we can contract external research labs to help us process the data we receive. These services aren't exactly cheap, but their R&D facilities are very impressive.
			#autoLOC_501160 = Patents Licensing
			#autoLOC_501161 = Our science data can be worth a lot of money by selling licenses for other organizations to use our patents. The added book-keeping required will probably add some extra work for the R&D team, but the financial benefits could be worth their reduced output.
			#autoLOC_501162 = Aggressive Negotiations
			#autoLOC_501163 = We can get better deals with our suppliers by taking up a more... assertive stance on our negotiations with them. They probably won't see this as a friendly move, but we can definitely have it our way if we press them. It's not as if we care what others think, do we?
			#autoLOC_501164 = Recovery Transponder Fitting
			#autoLOC_501165 = Recovering parts landed far away from the Space Center can be very costly, but I reckon we can reduce those costs by installing better transponders on the parts we launch. These units are not cheap, but they should make it much easier to find parts, improving the recovery value even if they're half-way around Kerbin. What do you say?
			#autoLOC_501166 = Bail-Out Grant
			#autoLOC_501167 = We must be in dire straits to be considering such an option. Accepting a public grant could save us from bankruptcy, but it would also put a very serious dent in the Space Program's reputation. However, the Space Program is too big to fail, so if it's either this option or closing shop, I would advise you to accept the money.
			#autoLOC_501168 = Research Rights Sell-Out
			#autoLOC_501169 = We could make a quick buck from the Science the R&D team has collected by selling exclusive research rights to the highest bidder. Yes, that means we wouldn't be able to make use of that Science ourselves, but for exclusive rights, I'm sure we could fetch a pretty penny from some large agency or conglomerate.
			#autoLOC_501170 = Leadership Initiative
			#autoLOC_501171 = If we focus our efforts on consistently pushing our own space program forward, we can drum up more public interest. We will need to put a few contracts on the backburner, so we may have to start selling research rights to the academic community to stay solvent.
			#autoLOC_501172 = Hopper
			#autoLOC_501173 = A starting craft. Can be built from the start of a career game, and is good enough to let you advance. Cheap, too!
			#autoLOC_501174 = Aeris 3A
			#autoLOC_501175 = The Aeris 3A is a small and nimble one-seater plane, mostly used as a training craft for fixed-wing flight, and to annoy ground staff by 'buzzing' the space center facilities. 
			#autoLOC_501176 = Aeris 4A
			#autoLOC_501177 = The Aeris 4A is a spaceplane capable of reaching orbit, if flown correctly.
			#autoLOC_501178 = Albatross 3
			#autoLOC_501179 = The Albatross 3 is a low-speed, long-range aircraft, capable of stable sustained flight for hours on end. Its very long wings will flex quite a bit, but the flight operations handbook says that's "most likely normal".It also recommends always using rudder and ailerons combined to turn it.
			#autoLOC_501180 = Bug-E Buggy
			#autoLOC_501181 = Bug-E is built to boldly go where no Kerman has gone before...EZ Attach Decoupler Included for quick integration to transport Vehicle.Warranty Void if used at nighttime.
			#autoLOC_501182 = Crater Crawler
			#autoLOC_501183 = While the Crater Crawler can be used on Kerbin if you're gentle, it really shines on a low G moon such as the Mun, where the built in thrusters allow an unparalleled level of manoeuvrability.
			#autoLOC_501184 = Dove
			#autoLOC_501185 = A Prototype Spaceplane capable of reaching Orbit. It has not yet been outfitted with any mission equipment.
			#autoLOC_501186 = Gull
			#autoLOC_501187 = A small and light seaplane, the Gull makes an excellent basic trainer for kerbals who aren't exactly sure when or where they will be landing (or "landing"). It can take off and land at shockingly low speeds (slower than some hotrodded rovers seen being driven around KSC by certain unnamed test pilots) thanks to its inner-wing flaps.
			#autoLOC_501188 = Mallard
			#autoLOC_501189 = The Mallard is a large seaplane with twin high-efficiency turbofans mounted high on the fuselage to clear the spray. It is somewhat slow but very steady in flight. A full suite of flaps on the trailing edges of the main wings give it exceptional low-speed lift, and small hydroplane steps mounted on each side of the fuselage bottom help lift it out of the water (lowering water drag) during takeoff runs. Its entire fuselage, absent the cockpit forward, is one long cargobay, with a ramp at the tail end. This allows rovers (and boats) to come aboard or leave while the Mallard is landed. It's a bit low on fuel, so you might consider adding some to the cargo bay for long flights, or make them at high altitude.
			#autoLOC_501190 = Osprey
			#autoLOC_501191 = A high-performance (and high-risk) seaplane, the Osprey is designed for those daredevils who don't want to sacrifice performance but still want to be able to land anywhere wet or dry on Kerbin. The afterburning Panther turbofan provides high efficiency in dry mode and high thrust in wet mode, perfect for strolls and sprints both.The outriggers have a hydroplane stretching between them, allowing the Osprey to "step up" during its takeoff run in the water, massively lowering drag. Once you step up, it's safe to take off. The outriggers are jettisonable, but they have the landing gear too. So don't stage away the outriggers unless you're planning one final water landing, however (or one very final indeed land "landing").
			#autoLOC_501192 = Prospector Rover
			#autoLOC_501193 = General Purpose Open Vacuum Rover for all your prospecting needs!Fuel Cell Power system for KM's of Range. Prospecting Science Package standard, and plenty of room for expansion on the Flatbed.Manufacturer recommends keeping brown parts facing ground.
			#autoLOC_501194 = Ravenspear Mk1
			#autoLOC_501195 = The first model of the Ravenspear series of fast, high-altitude aircraft, the Mk1 is fitted with three engines: One central one that is most efficient at low speeds, and two afterburning turbofans that are almost as efficient in dry thrust but provide quite a kick (at quite a cost) in wet mode.Its canard design has been called "very flyable, actually" by a few famous test pilots, although they also warn of the tendency to strike the tail on takeoff if pulling up too eagerly. Although they remark "it's good that there are more engines, if you break that middle one".
			#autoLOC_501196 = Ravenspear Mk3
			#autoLOC_501197 = The Ravenspear Mk3 is a longer-range high-altitude spaceplane, with a novel wing geometry that provides large amounts of lift at high altitudes. It is capable of sub-orbital flights, which makes it a decent test platform for high-altitude experimental engines and other such sciency things.
			#autoLOC_501198 = Ravenspear Mk4
			#autoLOC_501199 = The Mk4 marks a bit of a change in direction from previous Ravenspear models. Instead of focusing on high-altitude flight, the Mk4 is primarily geared towards making the most out of its four afterburning turbofans. In dry mode, however, it is capable of considerable range.Being capable of very high-speed flight at low altitudes, it's a favorite among the bravest test pilots, and quite the opposite for the not-so-brave ones.
			#autoLOC_501200 = Rocket-power VTOL
			#autoLOC_501201 = This craft is an experimental test platform for rocket-powered flight. Used primarily in training pilots to land on places where parachute descents aren't an option, it's also found a use in telling the ace pilots apart from the 'ok' ones, by the simple expedient of putting them in one of these, and calling "Ace" any that make it out afterwards.
			#autoLOC_501202 = Satellite Launcher
			#autoLOC_501203 = A conventional jet equipped with a small rocket to demonstrate feasibility of rocket launches from high altitude.
			#autoLOC_501204 = Skywinder AE1
			#autoLOC_501205 = The Skywinder AE1 is a sleek and agile plane that was originally used in air races and stunt shows sponsored by Green Kraken energy snacks. The front canards, thrust reversers, and built in safety parachute allowed daredevils to perform all sorts of creative maneuvers that sensible pilots would never even consider! Following a series of unfortunate events, it has since been donated to the space center for recreational use.
			#autoLOC_501206 = Stearwing A300
			#autoLOC_501207 = The Stearwing A300 is a large aircraft, built to carry heavy payloads and a large number of passengers. Don't expect it to reach very impressive altitudes or speeds though. Wings may shear off under excessive stress. Warranty does not cover damage from attempted aerobatics.
			#autoLOC_501208 = Stratolauncher
			#autoLOC_501209 = A Large drone plane designed to carry a rocket to an altitude of 10km and launch it from there. The drone can then theoretically return to the runway to be reused, provided avionics work.
			#autoLOC_501210 = Thunderbird
			#autoLOC_501211 = The Thunderbird is a muscle-car of an aircraft. Broadly similar in performance to the Osprey, it lacks the Osprey's graceful lines (and abilities as a seaplane) in exchange for a higher top speed. Indeed the Thunderbird is basically an engine with a cockpit and some wings bolted on...and therefore a huge success with the test pilots. Make sure you drop the droptanks when they empty to achieve best speed!
			#autoLOC_501212 = Velociteze
			#autoLOC_501213 = A small personnel transport using two small basic jets. Nowhere as efficient as turbofans, they nonetheless provide sterling service in this role (and are far less thirsty than an afterburner or turboramjet). The Velociteze is a well-tempered aircraft, fit for trainees versed on the Gull and Aeris 3A who want to step up to a multi-engine aircraft (and do some useful service ferrying passengers besides).
			#autoLOC_501214 = AeroEquus
			#autoLOC_501215 = The flying four legged neighing landcreature.Legend has it that the Equus can be ridden by brave Kerbals, all we know is that it takes a brave Kerbal to ride this four booster beast past the Mun, or if really foolhardy, past Minmus.
			#autoLOC_501216 = ComSat Lx
			#autoLOC_501217 = Tiny satellite with antenna and solar power?Launcher to bring it to space?Done and Done!
			#autoLOC_501218 = Dynawing
			#autoLOC_501219 = The Dynawing is a partially-reusable shuttle based around the Dynawing orbiter (with two KS25 engines) and an external tank to feed them, boosted by two Kickbacks. Hailed as the "next generation" of cheap access to space, with a payload of up to 16 tons (reference payload included), it is somewhat tricky to fly, as expensive as conventional rockets, and Kraken help you if something explodes on ascent. But it looks great, very futuristic. Flight crews are, of course, queuing up.The main engines fire roughly through the center of mass. Fly an inverted ascent with the shuttle on the 'down' side of the stack, and lead the prograde vector a bit. It's designed to use up all External Tank propellant on the first burn, horizontal by 45 km and keep burning to end up in a 75 x 0 km "orbit" or so. Then stage away  the tank, press 6 to disable the main engines, stage again to ignite the OMS engines, and use them to circularize and later deorbit. Fly a high-AoA reentry with RCS control.
			#autoLOC_501220 = GDLV3
			#autoLOC_501221 = The Generally Designed Launch Vehicle 3 is an adaptable design that the customer can tailor to their needs, in fact the GDLV3 is in such wide use no one can say they actually own it.
			#autoLOC_501222 = Ion-Powered Space Probe
			#autoLOC_501223 = This small probe may look cute and unimpressive, but once it deploys its long-range antenna, it looks pretty much the same.Its Ion engine is very efficient for a spacecraft this small, so it can go very far indeed, as long as something helps it get into orbit first, of course.
			#autoLOC_501224 = Jumping Flea
			#autoLOC_501225 = The Jumping Flea was originally named after the carnival ride that we salvaged most of its parts from. It might not get us all the way to space, but it will definitely get us started there with a bang!
			#autoLOC_501226 = Kerbal 1-5
			#autoLOC_501227 = A nice little Sunday runabout, the Kerbal 1-5 is just right for day trips to low Kerbin orbit.This model includes the optional docking port and RCS upgrade package, perfect for joining with your friends in space.
			#autoLOC_501228 = Kerbal 1
			#autoLOC_501229 = An exercise in rocket construction, just right for teaching the basics.It flies, what more do you need?
			#autoLOC_501230 = Kerbal 2
			#autoLOC_501231 = The Kerbal 2 was built as a 'trainer' rocket. It's not meant to reach very far, but it does feature most of the important systems found in the larger vessels.It also comes with a parachute. Most astronauts agree that that's one of its best features.
			#autoLOC_501232 = Kerbal X
			#autoLOC_501233 = The Kerbal X is one of the most successful rockets that can be ordered from a catalog. Despite the original design having been meant for a plastic model, it's proved itself quite dependable as a full-sized craft.The X is capable of achieving orbit around Kerbin, and even features a very optimistic set of landing legs on its upper stage.
			#autoLOC_501234 = Learstar A1
			#autoLOC_501235 = SSTO is overrated, payload capability and comfortable seats are all the rage these days.
			#autoLOC_501236 = Orbiter 1A
			#autoLOC_501237 = The Orbiter 1A is a training craft for orbital maneuvering. Despite not being able to reach orbit on its own, it's a very maneuverable and fun to fly ship once it gets there.
			#autoLOC_501238 = Orbiter One
			#autoLOC_501239 = We're not sure if the engineers named this craft for its series, or for the number of boosters, and our pilots call it "The Unfinished".Whatever the reason for the name, it's an interesting craft to fly.
			#autoLOC_501240 = PT Series Munsplorer
			#autoLOC_501241 = PT Munsplorer: No frills super economy class launcher/lander for Mun/Minmus.Batteries, fins and science sold separately.
			#autoLOC_501242 = Rover + Skycrane
			#autoLOC_501243 = This craft is one of the most ambitious designs found in the Kerlington catalog, especially if one takes the prospect of using it on another planet seriously. It requires a launch vehicle to get it into space (and beyond), but its four rockets do have enough thrust for short test runs at the pad.The operations manual says "approach ground slowly, try not to break the rover when you drop it".
			#autoLOC_501244 = Science Jr
			#autoLOC_501245 = A beginner's experimentation kit, complete with goggles, spatula and launch vehicle.For ages 3+.
			#autoLOC_501246 = Slim Shuttle
			#autoLOC_501247 = A partially reusable launch system for orbital tourism.
			#autoLOC_501248 = Space Station Core
			#autoLOC_501249 = This Space Station Core shows just how ambitious the Kerlington model rocket catalog can be sometimes. If you can manage to build a rocket capable of getting this into orbit, it is air-tight enough to let a few Kerbals live in it for long periods of time. It also features a hub with five docking ports, so you can expand your station.
			#autoLOC_501250 = Super-Heavy Lander
			#autoLOC_501251 = This lander may be heavy, but it packs a lot of RCS fuel and has a very funky boarding ladder.Launch vehicle sold separately.
			#autoLOC_501252 = Two-Stage Lander
			#autoLOC_501253 = Be the first to put a flag up on your favorite moon with this very sensible and mostly-survivable Lander Module.The first stage is meant to get it down to the surface, and can be jettisoned off for the ascent.Launch/return vehicle sold separately. Works best at low gravity and with no atmosphere around it.
			#autoLOC_501254 = Viewmatic Survey Satellite
			#autoLOC_501255 = The Viewmatic Survey Satellite was mysteriously found in low orbit around Kerbin. Its original purpose is unknown, but the space center has found it very useful for making sure that their staff are not using company phones for personal use.
			#autoLOC_501256 = Z-MAP Satellite Launch Kit
			#autoLOC_501257 = The Z-Map Satellite kit is a complete spacecraft capable of actually putting its payload into orbit! Set includes: Payload satellite with booster stage,Liquid-fueled fin-stabilized launcher and two detachable boosters.Return from orbit not guaranteed. Orbit also not guaranteed. Survival also not guaranteed. Keep out of reach of children and irresponsible adults.
			#autoLOC_501258 = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.
			#autoLOC_501259 = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
			#autoLOC_501260 = Reporting in at the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of air traffic, because I don't think we ever got clearance from the tower to be here.
			#autoLOC_501261 = This is our Space Center. We're home.
			#autoLOC_501262 = Hey, I can see my house from here, I think.
			#autoLOC_501263 = It's very comforting to see that much green below you.
			#autoLOC_501264 = You get a great view of the highlands.
			#autoLOC_501265 = The mountains rise up from the ground of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from way up here.

			#autoLOC_501267 = This looks like a bad place to land.
			#autoLOC_501268 = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
			#autoLOC_501269 = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.
			#autoLOC_501270 = The shores look inviting and you watch the waves roll in to the coast.
			#autoLOC_501271 = From this perspective you can see the underwater topography.
			#autoLOC_501272 = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
			#autoLOC_501273 = Maybe if you get out and push...
			#autoLOC_501274 = It's very... round.
			#autoLOC_501275 = Crew reporting in, from space!
			#autoLOC_501276 = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
			#autoLOC_501277 = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
			#autoLOC_501278 = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
			#autoLOC_501279 = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface...
			#autoLOC_501280 = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. Bet you could jetpack down there.
			#autoLOC_501281 = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
			#autoLOC_501282 = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.
			#autoLOC_501283 = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles, though.
			#autoLOC_501284 = You can't help but like Ike.
			#autoLOC_501285 = There appear to be some steep, rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color, and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.
			#autoLOC_501286 = Looking down, you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep.
			#autoLOC_501287 = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.
			#autoLOC_501288 = You watch the flowing green storms below, they seem to go on forever, endlessly swirling into each other.
			#autoLOC_501289 = This planet is a wholesome green color. You note down that more planets should be this color.
			#autoLOC_501290 = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin. You wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
			#autoLOC_501291 = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
			#autoLOC_501292 = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You do not think you'd like to try and land on them.
			#autoLOC_501293 = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
			#autoLOC_501294 = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more heavily cratered than the other.
			#autoLOC_501295 = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. For a second you thought you saw a face down there...
			#autoLOC_501296 = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
			#autoLOC_501297 = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
			#autoLOC_501298 = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
			#autoLOC_501299 = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
			#autoLOC_501300 = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
			#autoLOC_501301 = You search the sky for other nearby planets.  You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
			#autoLOC_501302 = You've recorded your observations about the situation.
			#autoLOC_501303 = It's getting very hot in here...
			#autoLOC_501304 = Everything is tinted purple. You feel like you're changing color.
			#autoLOC_501305 = Did you eat too much before you left? You feel so sluggish and heavy...
			#autoLOC_501306 = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you had brought an anchor.
			#autoLOC_501307 = I don't think a spacesuit was entirely necessary to get here, was it?
			#autoLOC_501308 = You feel kind of small right now... You hope you know where you're going.
			#autoLOC_501309 = This is a most precarious situation.
			#autoLOC_501310 = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.
			#autoLOC_501311 = The dust is getting everywhere!
			#autoLOC_501312 = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Suddenly, you feel very small.
			#autoLOC_501313 = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
			#autoLOC_501314 = You're having a bit too much fun with the low gravity.
			#autoLOC_501315 = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
			#autoLOC_501316 = You feel a bit like a superhero when you jump in the low gravity.

			#autoLOC_501322 = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
			#autoLOC_501323 = This place seems nice and comfortable. So comfortable you feel like taking your helmet off. You check the box on your report for -Looks breathable-.
			#autoLOC_501324 = After a few long seconds of gasping and haphazardly flailing about you manage to get used to the strange smell. You write a note on your report: 'breathable atmosphere - mouth only'.
			#autoLOC_501325 = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think you should probably get back to the ship.
			#autoLOC_501326 = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and reminds you of home. However, the lack of atmosphere is a stark contrast to Kerbin.
			#autoLOC_501327 = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
			#autoLOC_501328 = Everywhere you look it appears the planet is sharp. You don't think you want to sit down or fall on anything.
			#autoLOC_501329 = You lay down and give the planet a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.
			#autoLOC_501330 = You Observe the Goo.
			#autoLOC_501331 = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now.
			#autoLOC_501332 = The Goo seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here.
			#autoLOC_501333 = The Goo seems to hate it here.
			#autoLOC_501334 = The Goo escapes into the water!
			#autoLOC_501335 = The Goo wobbles around in its container and starts to seep out of the holes.
			#autoLOC_501336 = The Goo accumulates near the water-facing side of the container.
			#autoLOC_501337 = The Goo seems bored.

			#autoLOC_501341 = The Goo seems to be almost boiling. It writhes around the canister.
			#autoLOC_501342 = The Goo has become rubbery and bounces around the container.
			#autoLOC_501343 = The Goo takes on a purple coloration. Is it just the lighting, or did it change color?
			#autoLOC_501344 = The Goo takes on a red sheen. It looks very much like the planet below.
			#autoLOC_501345 = The Goo seems to be less dense here.
			#autoLOC_501346 = The Goo feels right at home here.
			#autoLOC_501347 = The canister begins to resonate, causing an odd harmonic effect inside the vessel. It's very unsettling.
			#autoLOC_501348 = Gooey tentacles reach out of the canister, freeze, and break off. Fascinating!
			#autoLOC_501349 = While observing the canister, you feel as though something is looking back at you from the shadows of the container.

			#autoLOC_501356 = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
			#autoLOC_501357 = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you've been in a climate-controlled environment, because it sure looks hot out there. The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
			#autoLOC_501358 = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
			#autoLOC_501359 = This isn't really solid ground, is it? You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the startling cracking sounds the ice made. You try to not think back on how you landed here.
			#autoLOC_501360 = You took a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
			#autoLOC_501361 = The grass here is definitely not as green as other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called the Badlands makes you feel cool.
			#autoLOC_501362 = You scooped up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample.  You hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
			#autoLOC_501363 = You've taken a sample of the water. It appears to dramatically increase the surface humidity of anything it touches.

			#autoLOC_501385 = Samples seems to contain frozen liquids... We'll need to send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.
			#autoLOC_501386 = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials layered over time.
			#autoLOC_501387 = The sample contains lesser amounts of basaltic rocks. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
			#autoLOC_501388 = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface!
			#autoLOC_501389 = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
			#autoLOC_501390 = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
			#autoLOC_501391 = This crater seems to be filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
			#autoLOC_501392 = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.

			#autoLOC_501394 = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for any rocks that look neat.
			#autoLOC_501395 = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Remembering that you're supposed to take a surface sample, you throw any old rocks you find into the container. Job done!
			#autoLOC_501396 = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!
			#autoLOC_501397 = This crater seems to have been a really nasty impact, and the samples are heavier than normal.
			#autoLOC_501398 = You're glad that the Mun's gravity is so low. Digging is backbreaking work!
			#autoLOC_501399 = This area has a particularly high concentration of rare elements. Nice!
			#autoLOC_501400 = Continual samples of this area confirm it is rich in useful materials.
			#autoLOC_501401 = You dig around for a nice sample of the crater, carefully selecting a little bit of everything.
			#autoLOC_501402 = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains. Very pretty, but probably not edible.
			#autoLOC_501403 = You sneak a taste of the surface sample... Nope, it definitely is not made of delicious dessert products.
			#autoLOC_501404 = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it grey and it just looks purple because everything else on Eve is? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.
			#autoLOC_501405 = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine, sand-like dust, and it appears to be getting everywhere.
			#autoLOC_501406 = There appear to be traces of water in the soil!
			#autoLOC_501407 = Unable to satisfy your curiousity, you attempt to drill into the rock with your tool. You're thinking it would be a lot easier if you had some kind of pulsating drill-thing on a robotic arm.
			#autoLOC_501408 = The ground is made up of old lava flows, suggesting periods of intense volcanic activity.
			#autoLOC_501409 = The surface gives away easily and you have a hard time keeping the sample in the container due to the low gravity.
			#autoLOC_501410 = The composition of elements is very similar to that of an asteroid.

			#autoLOC_501412 = The white soil has a powdery texture and clumps together.
			#autoLOC_501413 = You find traces of a large number of elements, likely deposited here by impacts over time.
			#autoLOC_501414 = After digging around for a bit, you find some nice bits of glass and throw them in your sample container.
			#autoLOC_501415 = The soil sample contains traces of salt. You wonder if it has blown here, or if this area was once under water.
			#autoLOC_501416 = You chip away the frozen surface and deposit some of the blue surface material into a container.
			#autoLOC_501417 = You dig around in the surface and find some beautiful green and blue crystal structures. They remind you a bit of home, but you're unable to pick out Kerbin from the mass of twinkling lights.
			#autoLOC_501418 = The ground gives way easily, but the surface underneath is much harder.
			#autoLOC_501419 = You hum a little tune while you work to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!
			#autoLOC_501420 = The brown dust stains all the parts of your suit that it comes in contact with. This is apparently quite amusing to flight control.
			#autoLOC_501421 = You dig through the surface and find a little sphere. It looks a bit like an egg.
			#autoLOC_501422 = As you shovel the contents into a container, you can't help but feel you'll be allergic to whatever it is.
			#autoLOC_501423 = The sample is the same odd mottle of colors as the planet from orbit. You check off a little box on your list.
			#autoLOC_501424 = After conducting samples of the surface, you determine with a high certainty that Pol is not, in fact, made of Pollen. This will cause quite the stir back home!
			#autoLOC_501425 = Chipping away at the icy surface, you find some brown soil underneath.
			#autoLOC_501426 = You find a beautiful crystal and place it in the sample container.
			#autoLOC_501427 = The rocks contain thin wisps of color. They remind you of lovely ION exhaust trails...

			#autoLOC_501429 = Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss.........
			#autoLOC_501430 = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
			#autoLOC_501431 = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.
			#autoLOC_501432 = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you silently.

			#autoLOC_501493 = The pressure gauge is sitting there motionless. Perhaps you should tap it a few times to be sure?

			#autoLOC_501495 = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.
			#autoLOC_501496 = The atmosphere is pretty thin even at the surface. You don't think parachutes or wings would work very well here.

			#autoLOC_501716 = We're not sure if there really is such a thing as too many struts, but we'd like to find out.
			#autoLOC_501717 = We're trying to figure out if all matter in the universe is as dense as on Kerbin, but haven't come up with a conclusive test for it.
			#autoLOC_501718 = We want to know what shades of green we'll see if we expose a Kerbal to high gee forces.
			#autoLOC_501719 = There are fewer asteroids in orbit of [Topic] than the standard model would predict.
			#autoLOC_501720 = We believe that an asteroid in orbit of [Topic] is worth two in space, and would like to prove it.
			#autoLOC_501721 = We'd like to run some experiments on the feasibility of long-term Kerbal habitation outside of Kerbin as part of the [Topic] project.
			#autoLOC_501722 = We need someone to apply the scientific method... in space!
			#autoLOC_501723 = We're looking for some scientific data. We'd really prefer some new data, but we'd be really happy with any data at all, really.
			#autoLOC_501724 = We have some forms to fill out, and we're pretty sure it would be way more interesting if we filled it out using science data from space.
			#autoLOC_501725 = Our science containers are all empty, and nobody wants to run out to another biome to fill one.
			#autoLOC_501726 = We still have unchecked items on our list of records to break and would like to change that.
			#autoLOC_501727 = Nobody has set any space records yet! It would probably be best to just start by getting something off the launchpad. Then we can start worrying about things like "survivability".
			#autoLOC_501728 = The problem is that we don't actually have any idea how difficult it is to get a Kerbal to orbit, and we need to find out quickly.
			#autoLOC_501729 = We want to know how many planets we can send a Kerbal to before they start ignoring us and fly the ship back.
			#autoLOC_501730 = We're trying to assemble an interplanetary color wheel, and need someone to verify it against a few different celestial bodies.
			#autoLOC_501731 = We're not saying that there are aliens on another planet in our solar system, but... aliens.
			#autoLOC_501732 = We'd like to know if getting [Topic] from somewhere other than Kerbin is as easy as taking snacks from a juvenile Kerbal.
			#autoLOC_501733 = We think that we can prove that there's an abundance of [Topic] throughout the solar system.
			#autoLOC_501734 = There is very little knowledge about how the [Topic] performs under conditions not found in a standard laboratory.
			#autoLOC_501735 = The manual clearly states that the [Topic] is the best in its class. To avoid legal complications, we're going to need proof to justify our claims.
			#autoLOC_501736 = We have way too many parts like the [Topic], and nobody's sure how they work.
			#autoLOC_501737 = We don't actually know how to attach a [Topic] to other parts. From the bottom? The top? Is there even a way to tell which side is up?
			#autoLOC_501738 = If we could have our flag proudly standing on the surface of [Topic], we would surely prove ourselves better than the competition.
			#autoLOC_501739 = We want to verify that a flag planted by an astronaut is the best way to test the rigidity of the surface of [Topic].
			#autoLOC_501740 = We think that the aesthetic of [Topic] would be greatly improved with just one more flag, but we're not able to get one there ourselves.
			#autoLOC_501741 = Apparently, using crewed craft is not a good way to test theories on the dangers of space junk. If you could bring [Topic] back home, we promise not to leave anyone else up there.
			#autoLOC_501742 = We've lost a Kerbal! Could you find [Topic] for us? Their snack supplies may be starting to run a little low.
			#autoLOC_501743 = We've been performing a lot of experiments with leaving Kerbals in space for extended periods of time. Things were going great, until [Topic] woke up one morning and decided to walk out of their capsule.
			#autoLOC_501744 = So apparently, [Topic] is having a lot of trouble with their EVA jetpack. So much so that the rest of the crew may have forgotten to wait for them to get back to the capsule, resulting in them being left in orbit.
			#autoLOC_501745 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating delta-v without a Kerbal on board (a "Mechanical Bill Kerman" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
			#autoLOC_501746 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating orbital information without a Kerbal on board (a "Jebediah's Engineer" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
			#autoLOC_501747 = We've got a competition to see which agency can get the most satellites in particular orbits, and would like some assistance.
			#autoLOC_501748 = We want to be a part of building some really big space stations, and the [Topic] project is a great opportunity.
			#autoLOC_501749 = We don't know too many interesting things about [Topic], and would like to take a look around.
			#autoLOC_501750 = Some Kerbals say that every place on [Topic] looks exactly the same. We disagree, but need someome else to prove them wrong.
			#autoLOC_501751 = We want to know if there are Kerbals that will really pay for the extra seats that you surely already have on your craft.
			#autoLOC_501752 = To get to orbit, we think all we need is for a Kerbal with terrible aim to shoot for the ground and miss.
			#autoLOC_501753 = We want to know if it's as fun as it seems to be in zero-G.
			#autoLOC_501754 = We aren't sure if a day on Kerbin is 6 or 24 hours long.
			#autoLOC_501755 = We'd like to check if Kerbin is in fact perfectly round, and not an oblate spheroid as some lunatics suggest.
			#autoLOC_501756 = We want to know if going to the Mun is a good idea or not.
			#autoLOC_501757 = We need to know if Mun Pies would really sell (what a time to be alive!).
			#autoLOC_501758 = There's no way for us to know if the surface of the Mun is as pretty as everyone thinks.
			#autoLOC_501759 = We want to know if Minmus is really a myth or not.
			#autoLOC_501760 = We're not sure how pretty Minmus is up close.
			#autoLOC_501761 = We need to know if Minmus Mint Chip ice cream would really sell.
			#autoLOC_501762 = We believe that it would be a lot of fun to jump around on Minmus.
			#autoLOC_501763 = If the surface of Minmus isn't edible, will Kerbals still try to eat it?
			#autoLOC_501764 = How far does something that goes up have to go before it doesn't come down again?
			#autoLOC_501765 = We suspect that there's interesting places to see beyond Kerbin and all its moons, although we suspect there's a lot of empty space in between.
			#autoLOC_501766 = Now we need your help.
			#autoLOC_501767 = This is why we're here.
			#autoLOC_501768 = So this is where you come in.
			#autoLOC_501769 = We believe that you are much better positioned to deal with this than us.
			#autoLOC_501770 = So please get us an asteroid, but watch out with that claw.
			#autoLOC_501771 = We need you to science the... Kerbal out of this.
			#autoLOC_501772 = So if you could point some of those satellites our way, we'd be rather pleased.
			#autoLOC_501773 = But really, there's no sense in us still talking while there's science to be done. Shall we get to it?
			#autoLOC_501774 = It's time for you to take another step in advancing the frontier.
			#autoLOC_501775 = So, when can we expect the first shipment?
			#autoLOC_501776 = So we need a few simple tests run for us.
			#autoLOC_501777 = It would really help us out if you're able to run a test.
			#autoLOC_501778 = So, up for planting a flag?
			#autoLOC_501779 = We'd be quite grateful if you could perform this recovery operation for us.
			#autoLOC_501780 = So, can you take a few extra Kerbals with you on your next flight?
			#autoLOC_501781 = TD-06 Decoupler
			#autoLOC_501782 = The TD-06 Stack Decoupler is a miniature detachment device for small rockets
			#autoLOC_501783 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501784 = TD-12 Decoupler
			#autoLOC_501785 = The TD-12 Stack Decoupler is equipped with a (hopefully) small explosive charge, that will sever the structural linkage between itself and whatever it's connected to. Painted on its sides are handy arrows indicating which side will detach
			#autoLOC_501786 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501787 = TD-25 Decoupler
			#autoLOC_501788 = O.M.B. is pleased to bring you the latest in decoupling technologies - twice the size of the next best selling product, it offers plenty of bang for plenty of buck! As with its smaller, woefully inferior competitors, this decoupler has handy arrows to indicate which side it will detach from.
			#autoLOC_501789 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501790 = TD-37 Decoupler
			#autoLOC_501791 = Originally designed for separating buildings that were stuck together, O.M.B. has repurposed these explosive bolts for use in separating stacks of massive rockets.
			#autoLOC_501792 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501793 = TS-06 Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_501794 = The TS-06 is a utility for slicing a rocket into two halves, but in a more compact size. The manual says the explosive content is just enough to eject anything attached to the unit in a safe, controlled manner. The delivery guy did have a full bomb suit on though, so try not to drop it.
			#autoLOC_501795 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501796 = TS-12 Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_501797 = Unlike Decouplers, Separators jettison everything attached to them. This new technology was very well received by rocket engineers everywhere. Not bad for something that started out as a failure for a controlled explosive bolt prototype
			#autoLOC_501798 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501799 = TS-25 Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_501800 = The TS-25 is designed for slicing the largest of rockets in twain. Unlike Decouplers, Separators will eject anything connected to themselves. This is good, as it removes the need to worry about which side needs to be pointed away from face. Try to not look at it too much though.
			#autoLOC_501801 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501802 = TS-37 Stack Separator
			#autoLOC_501803 = This separator is dangerous whichever way you look at it. Be cautious when armed.
			#autoLOC_501804 = decouple
			#autoLOC_501805 = Mk1-3 Command Pod

			#autoLOC_900077 = This moon was especially hard to spot, as it looks just like a pollen grain, particularly when observed through telescopes based near dusty fields.Pol was finally discovered when someone decided to write down the location of the pollen, after having given up on yet another failed attempt to be rid of the smudge.
			#autoLOC_900080 = Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered by the Kerbal Astronomical Society. After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon.Scientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall and Jool overhead must be “quite something”.
			#autoLOC_900082 = Vall was one of the last Moons of Jool to be discovered. Frustrated scientists kept attempting to wipe it off the lenses of their telescopes. Eventually after a rash of returned telescopes, Advanced Optics Co. finally decided to just tell them it was an actual object in the sky.
			#autoLOC_900084 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Kerbin.Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that “telescopes don’t work that way”.The intern was shortly afterwards “promoted” and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
			#autoLOC_900086 = Ike is a relatively large, grey object occasionally seen orbiting Duna. Scientists have postulated that Ike is seemingly perfectly positioned to sneakily interfere with any object that presumes to come orbiting near its parent.
			#autoLOC_900088 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. From the surface of Kerbin, it can be seen on clear days as a tiny blue speck in the sky. It is often mistaken as dirt on telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us it is a real moon nevertheless.
			#autoLOC_900090 = The Mun, is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.The Mun’s discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted, it didn’t happen all that long ago, but it’s still fair to say Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
			#autoLOC_900092 = Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve. It’s by far the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society has discovered.Due to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with being an accomplished Astronomer.
			#autoLOC_900094 = There’s been a considerable amount of controversy around the status of Eeloo as being a proper planet or a just “lump of ice going around the Sun”. The debate is still ongoing, since most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls.
			#autoLOC_900096 = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration.If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy.
			#autoLOC_900098 = Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. It’s orbit is highly irregular and together with it’s size it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet.Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space. This dwarf planet was officially labeled as “Not to be trusted” by the scientific community.
			#autoLOC_900100 = Also known as the red dot that you can see if you squint at it really hard, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind. The planet has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green.
			#autoLOC_900101 = A unique world, Kerbin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. Home to the Kerbals, it has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of the eager green creatures.Reaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that those who can get their ship into orbit are halfway to anywhere.
			#autoLOC_900103 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It’s one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint.It is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme press- ures and temperatures. Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?
			#autoLOC_900105 = Moho figures in Kerbal mythology as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality however, it’s much less interesting. Scientists speculate about possible ways to make it “awesome like in the stories”. Some of those ideas have led to new breakthroughs in aerospace technology.
			#autoLOC_900108 = At the Runway, spacecraft built in the Spaceplane Hangar have a long flat surface to reach take-off speed. Conceivably, such aircraft could even land back on it.
			#autoLOC_900109 = Space Plane

			#autoLOC_900125 = The VAB is where spacecraft are designed and built, before being moved over to the Launchpad for flight.
			#autoLOC_900127 = At the R&D Facility, our team of scientists works hard to crunch the data received from mission experiments. Here, all researched technologies can be viewed, and new ones discovered.

			#autoLOC_6005008 = Welcome to KSP 1.5: Dressed for Success. In this release we've included a number of general improvements and fixes to the game as well as a few surprises.You will find the ability to assign Kerbals to Command Seats, enhancements to the Burn Time Indicator that will allow you to better plan and perform your ship's maneuvers, and new suits to make your Kerbals look their very best as they face their (potentially) impending fiery doom.Also included are fixes, tweaks, and revisions to a number of parts, and many smaller adjustments and bug fixes across the whole game. Along with all that are improved support for 4K displays, and fine tuning of the Asteroid physics. As always, the full list of changes and improvements can be found in the release notes!Thanks for playing!

			#autoLOC_6005016 = Welcome to KSP 1.6: To Vee or not to Vee! We've got a lot of great new things for you. First, HUGE navigation improvements! First up: the addition of a Delta-v readout to the staging diagram! Now pilots besides Jeb can have absolute confidence in whether they have the fuel & thrust to reach orbit - of course, Jeb never has any doubts. The readout works per-stage as well, to help you find those flaws in your staging setup.Second: We've also added navigation icons to help you steer toward KSC or one of your other landing sites.Finally, you can now change the navball orientation on many control parts to help you point in the right direction when flying or driving, allowing the same part to work in both a driving-oriented and lander configuration. Hint: Check out the variants for the Mk2 Lander Can!We also have some fantastic visual improvements. For one thing, Kerbals will finally be able to take their helmets off. Better put them back on before trying to fly to space though - or better yet, get back in the capsule, you daredevils.We also have some fun new idle animations for them on the ground and while spacewalking. We've added dynamic cube maps, so shiny parts can reflect their environment, and some shadow tweaks. And last but not least, many, many more beautiful part revamps!

			#autoLOC_6012030 = Welcome to KSP 1.7: Room to Maneuver! This version update, as the name implies, is full of new features and improvements to help you guide your rockets through space. We have two new navigation tool upgrades. Up at the top of your flight screen, you’ll see a mysterious new icon next to the altimeter. Click the altimeter and it’ll toggle from a sea-level readout to an above ground readout, so now Jeb will be able to land your ship instruments-only. And actually have them stay in one piece this time. On the bottom left of your flight screen, there’s a new icon with all the other mode toggles. Click that to find out we’ve added ‘Maneuver Mode.’ It’ll open up with a single panel that gives you access - in both Map AND Flight mode, to orbital information like apoapsis, periapsis, eccentricity, etc. Better yet, put down a maneuver node, and you’ll get a second panel that lets you adjust that maneuver, to help you fine tune your interplanetary transfers. Visually, we’ve updated all of the small maneuvering motors - the Ant, Twitch, Puff, Place-Anywhere 7, RV-105 Thruster Block, and Vernor Engine all have an improved art treatment, and the Twitch, Ant and Spider have new variants. We’ve also got an upgraded galaxy map for you to enjoy while you’re cruising between the planets.To round out the mix, we’ve added scroll bars to the part action windows when they get too big - very useful if you’ve got mods filling those up - and new tuning values on some of those small maneuver engines. Plus a new 3.75 meter nose cone and a 5m one for those of you with Making History! We hope you enjoy version 1.7 Room to Maneuver!

The discovery led to the invention of the Aerodynamically Integrated Retrograde Braking Robustly Armed Kinetic Extending System (A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.), which is now popular mostly as a cheap alternative to longer runways. C7 Engineers are still trying to come up with a shorter name for such a long acronym.

Heavy research into two-dimensional-input driven procedural construction was then funded with the hopes of making protective shells for important payloads and interstage areas of the crafts. The protective shells also have the benefit of making the craft more aerodynamic, hopefully saving on precious rocket fuel!

		description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

		description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

		description = Kerbodyne's flagship engine, the KS-25 excels as a first stage engine through its high thrust-to-weight ratio and exceptional sea level efficiency. Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

Why not turn the rocket parts upside down and shake them? The grabbing arm perfectly filled this niche, and is quite capable of lifting heavy machinery. It has since found other uses, besides delicate tool extraction operations. AKA "The Klaw!"

The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.

			TyloSrfLanded = The ground gives way easily, but the surface underneath is much harder.
			TyloSrfLanded = You hum a little tune while you work to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!

		Introduction
		{
			Generic = As a consequence of a somewhat worse than average accident at [Agency], we've been forced to look for some outside help.
			Generic = While working late nights, the scientists at [Agency] have made a startling discovery.
			Generic = While cleaning up after an unintended ignition, one of the overworked teams at [Agency] raised an interesting question.
			Generic = The board of directors at [Agency] have raised some troubling issues.
			Generic = The CEO (and chief bottle washer) at [Agency] has stumbled on a problem.
			Generic = The number of times we've achieved sudden combustion at [Agency] has lead us to consider something.
			Generic = At [Agency], we're not afraid to try new things. As a result, we sometimes find ourselves in the situation of needing outside help to solve a problem.
			ARM = We've got some pretty impressive rock collections at [Agency].
			Base = [Agency] can think of nothing more prestigious than taking a Kerbal, and leaving them behind on another world.
			CollectScience = We have the finest scientific minds working at [Agency], and we've been thinking about giving them something to do.
			CollectScience = The research department at [Agency] is very close to figuring out a unified theory of gravioli.
			Exploration = At [Agency], we need brave Kerbals with the right stuff to help achieve our dreams.
			Exploration = One of the founding principles of [Agency] is to continue to advance the frontiers of science.
			PartTest = While hitting parts with a wrench, the engineers at [Agency] realized we had a problem.
			PartTest = We've been reviewing our product catalog at [Agency] and have found an oversight.
			PlantFlag = We're very proud of our flag at [Agency], and wanted to do something special with it.
			PlantFlag = As part of [Agency]'s commitment to strong corporate statements, we've been looking for ways to get our brand out there.
			RecoverAsset = At [Agency], we're Kerbal enough to admit when mistakes are made. This is one of those times.
			RecoverAsset = We're not usually in the habit of misplacing things at [Agency], but we may have lost something big.
			Satellite = We're constantly looking for how to make better use of satellites at [Agency].
			Satellite = As a result of some surplus parts at the [Agency] warehouses, we've got some more opportunities for orbital satellites.
			Station = To meet our quota of "useful things in space", we've been looking into station building projects at [Agency].
			Survey = We've been poring over maps at the [Agency] offices looking for points of interest, and may have come up with something.
			Survey = While using the [Agency] dart board as a waypoint planner, we've come up with something interesting.
			Tourism = We're always looking for new revenue streams at [Agency]. Our accountants have told us that space tourism is a growth industry and we'd like to get in on it.
		}
		Problem
		{
			Generic = We may have underestimated just how volatile solid rocket fuel really is, and have now found ourselves with a problem we can't solve on our own.
			Generic = To test out some of our more advanced theories, we need more debris in low orbit.
			Generic = We're not sure if there really is such a thing as too many struts, but we'd like to find out.
			Generic = We're trying to figure out if all matter in the universe is as dense as on Kerbin, but haven't come up with a conclusive test for it.
			Generic = We want to know what shades of green we'll see if we expose a Kerbal to high gee forces.
			ARM = There are fewer asteroids in orbit of [Topic] than the standard model would predict.
			ARM = We believe that an asteroid in orbit of [Topic] is worth two in space, and would like to prove it.
			Base = We'd like to run some experiments on the feasibility of long-term Kerbal habitation outside of Kerbin as part of the [Topic] project.
			CollectScience = We need someone to apply the scientific method... in space!
			CollectScience = We're looking for some scientific data. We'd really prefer some new data, but we'd be really happy with any data at all, really.
			CollectScience = We have some forms to fill out, and we're pretty sure it would be way more interesting if we filled it out using science data from space.
			CollectScience = Our science containers are all empty, and nobody wants to run out to another biome to fill one.
			Exploration = We still have unchecked items on our list of records to break and would like to change that.
			Launch = Nobody has set any space records yet! It would probably be best to just start by getting something off the launchpad. Then we can start worrying about things like "survivability".
			Orbit = The problem is that we don't actually have any idea how difficult it is to get a Kerbal to orbit, and we need to find out quickly.
			GrandTour = We want to know how many planets we can send a Kerbal to before they start ignoring us and fly the ship back.
			GrandTour = We're trying to assemble an interplanetary color wheel, and need someone to verify it against a few different celestial bodies.
			GrandTour = We're not saying that there are aliens on another planet in our solar system, but... aliens.
			ISRU = We'd like to know if getting [Topic] from somewhere other than Kerbin is as easy as taking snacks from a juvenile Kerbal.
			ISRU = We think that we can prove that there's an abundance of [Topic] throughout the solar system.
			PartTest = There is very little knowledge about how the [Topic] performs under conditions not found in a standard laboratory.
			PartTest = The manual clearly states that the [Topic] is the best in its class. To avoid legal complications, we're going to need proof to justify our claims.
			PartTest = We have way too many parts like the [Topic], and nobody's sure how they work.
			PartTest = We don't actually know how to attach a [Topic] to other parts. From the bottom? The top? Is there even a way to tell which side is up?
			PlantFlag = If we could have our flag proudly standing on the surface of [Topic], we would surely prove ourselves better than the competition.
			PlantFlag = We want to verify that a flag planted by an astronaut is the best way to test the rigidity of the surface of [Topic].
			PlantFlag = We think that the aesthetic of [Topic] would be greatly improved with just one more flag, but we're not able to get one there ourselves.
			RecoverAsset = Apparently, using crewed craft is not a good way to test theories on the dangers of space junk. If you could bring [Topic] back home, we promise not to leave anyone else up there.
			RecoverKerbal = We've lost a Kerbal! Could you find [Topic] for us? Their snack supplies may be starting to run a little low.
			RecoverKerbal = We've been performing a lot of experiments with leaving Kerbals in space for extended periods of time. Things were going great, until [Topic] woke up one morning and decided to walk out of their capsule.
			RecoverKerbal = So apparently, [Topic] is having a lot of trouble with their EVA jetpack. So much so that the rest of the crew may have forgotten to wait for them to get back to the capsule, resulting in them being left in orbit.
			RecoverPart = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating delta-v without a Kerbal on board (a "Mechanical Bill Kerman" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
			RecoverPart = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating orbital information without a Kerbal on board (a "Jebediah's Engineer" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
			Satellite = We've got a competition to see which agency can get the most satellites in particular orbits, and would like some assistance.
			Station = We want to be a part of building some really big space stations, and the [Topic] project is a great opportunity.
			Survey = We don't know too many interesting things about [Topic], and would like to take a look around.
			Survey = Some Kerbals say that every place on [Topic] looks exactly the same. We disagree, but need someome else to prove them wrong.
			Tourism = We want to know if there are Kerbals that will really pay for the extra seats that you surely already have on your craft.
			Orbit = To get to orbit, we think all we need is for a Kerbal with terrible aim to shoot for the ground and miss.
			Orbit = We want to know if it's as fun as it seems to be in zero-G.
			Kerbin = We aren't sure if a day on Kerbin is 6 or 24 hours long.
			Kerbin = We'd like to check if Kerbin is in fact perfectly round, and not an oblate spheroid as some lunatics suggest.
			Mun = We want to know if going to the Mun is a good idea or not.
			Mun = We need to know if Mun Pies would really sell (what a time to be alive!).
			MunSrf = There's no way for us to know if the surface of the Mun is as pretty as everyone thinks.
			Minmus = We want to know if Minmus is really a myth or not.
			Minmus = We're not sure how pretty Minmus is up close.
			Minmus = We need to know if Minmus Mint Chip ice cream would really sell.
			MinmusSrf = We believe that it would be a lot of fun to jump around on Minmus.
			MinmusSrf = If the surface of Minmus isn't edible, will Kerbals still try to eat it?
			Sun = How far does something that goes up have to go before it doesn't come down again?
			Sun = We suspect that there's interesting places to see beyond Kerbin and all its moons, although we suspect there's a lot of empty space in between.
		}
		Conclusion
		{
			Generic = Now we need your help.
			Generic = This is why we're here.
			Generic = So this is where you come in.
			Generic = We believe that you are much better positioned to deal with this than us.
			ARM = So please get us an asteroid, but watch out with that claw.
			CollectScience = We need you to science the... Kerbal out of this.
			CollectScience = So if you could point some of those satellites our way, we'd be rather pleased.
			Exploration = But really, there's no sense in us still talking while there's science to be done. Shall we get to it?
			Exploration = It's time for you to take another step in advancing the frontier.
			ISRU = So, when can we expect the first shipment?
			PartTest = So we need a few simple tests run for us.
			PartTest = It would really help us out if you're able to run a test.
			PlantFlag = So, up for planting a flag?
			RecoverAsset = We'd be quite grateful if you could perform this recovery operation for us.
			Tourism = So, can you take a few extra Kerbals with you on your next flight?

		{
			default = The fish swim in circles around the tank as the pump equipment happily buzzes.
			SunInSpaceLow = The fish are unhappy and the prawns are cooked. Well, saves time during meal prep!
			SunInSpaceHigh = The slowly circling gyre of the various species in the tank matches your observations of the solar corona.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = The fish seem a little out of sorts. Perhaps they're aching for the wide oceans you see out the porthole.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = You measure the biophysical properties of the fish. A calcium deficiency seems to be rearing its head.
			KerbinSrfLanded = Everything seems to be happily swimming around in its tank.
			MunInSpaceLow = The desolation of the Munar surface doesn't betray even a hint of water. You almost feel like the fish understand this as they stay away from the sides of the tank.
			MunInSpaceHigh = As you hurtle around the planet, you being to reflect on the feasibility of grilling a fish on the tank heat exchanger.
			MunSrfLanded = The low gravity seems to throw the fish off a bit - they bob up and down irregularly. The prawns seem happy though.
			MinmusInSpaceLow = Fish and minty ice cream go together so well - oh, I'm sorry, I was supposed to be running this spectral analyzer...
			MinmusInSpaceHigh = The fish swim in circles around the tank as the pump equipment happily buzzes.
			MinmusSrfLanded = The low gravity doesn't feel like much to the fish or you. You wonder if the KSC has though of putting a fish in a small spacesuit with an EVA jetpack.
			MohoInSpaceLow = The fish swim in circles around the tank as the pump equipment works hard to keep the temperature at equilibrium.
			MohoInSpaceHigh = You wish you'd brought a few tropical fish on the trip. The tank heat exchanger is running at full power!
			MohoSrfLanded = Ah, sweet gravity. You bet you could cook the fish on the hot rocks outside
			EveInSpaceLow = The purple seas of Eve beckon! You can't wait to test the reaction of the fish to the planet's interestingly coloured water.
			EveInSpaceHigh = Hurtling toward the planet at high speed, you measure the tastiness-er, health of the fish.
			EveSrfLanded = Holy gadzooks did that solution kill those fish quickly! You guiltily drain the tank that had the Eve water sample in it, faintly conscious of the ticking of the tank radiation counter.
			IkeInSpaceLow = It's not hard to like Ike, but the fish seem to disagree.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = This is as good a place as any for raising fish.
			IkeSrfLanded = Landing on Ike, you find the fish crowded towards the porthole, staring at the sight of majestic Duna rising in the distance.
			DunaInSpaceLow = Ice caps and dust! You feel like the fish could like this planet.
			DunaInSpaceHigh = Heading in towards Duna, you feel a sense of accomplishment for having kept the fish alive so far.
			DunaSrfLanded = Someone has contaminated the tank with planetary dust! The red colour is somewhat worrying!
			DresInSpaceLow = It's lonely near Dres, but luckily the blowfish is keeping you company.
			DresInSpaceHigh = While here, floating in your tin can, you reflect on canned fish products.
			DresSrfLanded = Nobody likes it here, with the exception of the prawns.
			JoolInSpaceLow = While observing the planet's colourful storms, you realize the temperature probe has been in the fish tank since the last experiment. You hurriedly remove it.
			JoolInSpaceHigh = The green planet reminds you of the peas from your rehydrated meal packed that you fed to the fish last night.
			JoolInSpace = The fish chuckle at your lunacy.
			LaytheInSpaceLow = What a beautiful world! You wonder if there are any specimens of aquatic life down there to add to your collection.
			LaytheInSpaceHigh = This world looks fish friendly. As you tell the fish this, you sense that they are indifferent.
			LaytheSrfLanded = Some fish are missing. It appears one of your crew have taken the liberty of releasing them into the Laythian seas, contaminating them for years to come.
			VallInSpaceLow = Frigid! You crank the tank heater. The fish look happier.
			VallInSpaceHigh = Time to whip out your fish bio-spectral analyzer probe! No, stop snickering, that wasn't innuendo.
			VallSrfLanded = You can't help but wish you'd brought some colder-water fish. The chunk of Vall's icy surface you dissolved in the tank is throwing off the temperature distribution.
			TyloInSpaceLow = The fish look straight back at you, making you want to reconsider your mission choices.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = The pull of Tylo's gravity is similar to Kerbin's, so you'd think the fish would be pleased. Instead, they're not. Oh yeah, you're still in orbit.
			TyloSrfLanded = The fish sulk at the bottom of the tank, looking happy to be back in normal gravity but somehow depressed by the bare landscape outside.
			BopInSpaceLow = The fish seem disoriented and repeatedly bop into each other.
			BopInSpaceHigh = The fish are excited at the thought of gravity again, and begin bopping against the top of the tank.
			BopSrfLanded = Science log, supplemental. These fish look tasty but the captain has locked the access hatch.
			PolInSpaceLow = Some of the fish are a similar colour to the moon out the window. Fancy that!
			PolInSpaceHigh = Biospectral analysis indicates the fish have suffered a lot of bone loss, and look a little droopy. You might not need to debone them at this rate.
			PolSrfLanded = You think you might need some new fish. The Pol-len doesn't seem to make great fish food, and you're wondering if the dead ones are safe to eat.
			EelooInSpaceLow = Arriving in close orbit around the planet, you observe the aquaponics reservoir. Things seem more or less the same as last time.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = This fish have huddled together for protection from the loneliness of the void. You wish you could get in there too.
			EelooSrfLanded = This far from home, you continue to wonder about how eating a few of the fish would improve rations, and how it would affect the science results.

		{
			default = The plants are as mellow and serene as can be. No, you can't harvest them yet.
			SunInSpaceLow = An associate external climate sensor's needle leans pretty close to the red. For the love of the nearest cook, keep those shutters closed!
			SunInSpaceHigh = You open a shutter to see what difference its impact on a plant may be, now that you are beyond Kerbin's influence... and its protection... A plant shrivels visibly quickly. You make a note to absolutely never do this again.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = The plants grow very slowly, if at all. It may be far too soon for any note-worthy results to appear.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = You open a shutter to see what impact it may have on the plants. Nothing happens immediately but later on you log that one of them has shriveled and possibly burned, particularly a sun-ward plant. That's not a good sign.
			KerbinSrfLanded = The plants sparkle. They must be quite happy to be here.
			MunInSpaceLow = The taller plants gravitate toward the Mun. Get it? Gravitate?
			MunInSpaceHigh = As you study the plants you ponder the possibility of farming on Mun's surface.
			MunSrfLanded = You're tempted to shovel some Mun soil into a pot and sow it. However, a bit of red tape needs to be cut for this dream to take root.
			MinmusInSpaceLow = Several leaves seem to change color. They appear to be trying to make some form of connection with Minmus.
			MinmusInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate toward Minmus. How is it possible with Minmus' miniscule gravity?
			MinmusSrfLanded = Is Minmus made of ice cream? Will the plants grow in it? You beg for R&D's permission for this test.
			MohoInSpaceLow = The plants have darkened a bit but they seem as fine as ever.
			MohoInSpaceHigh = You spot a large hole in the soil of a sample plant, and the plant itself is gone... What the kraken?
			MohoSrfLanded = It actually worries you, the idea of sampling this soil for the experiment. You hesitate to begin.
			EveInSpaceLow = Gravitating towards Eve now, you wonder whether they changed their minds or if it's finally actual gravioli that's pulling them.
			EveInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate...away from Eve. They must want not to be here.
			EveSrfLanded = The plants grow thicker and shorter, and their taller portions wither. Eve's gravity must be overwhelming them.
			IkeInSpaceLow = The plants gravitate toward Ike. The plants like Ike.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The transit time seemed to be on point. The seasonal plants are flowering.
			IkeSrfLanded = You fetch some Ike soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant grows faster than normal. It looks like Mun has competition.
			DunaInSpaceLow = The plants are in full bloom. Now is as good a time as any to try to colonize Duna.
			DunaInSpaceHigh = You note a mild but increasing redness in the fruits and flowers.
			DunaSrfLanded = You fetch some Duna soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant shows signs of starvation, maybe even poisoning. You determine that the metal content is too dang high!
			DresInSpaceLow = The plants no longer respond. They are mellow and they grow at their normal pace.
			DresInSpaceHigh = The plants release water droplets and they float about loosely, or slowly fall away back into their soil. Perhaps they are showing more emotion? Are they crying?
			DresSrfLanded = You fetch some Dres soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers away due to starvation. It's as if the plant did not or could not acknowledge the presence of any soil.
			JoolInSpaceLow = The plants sparkle again. Something about Jool must really appeal to them.
			JoolInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate toward Jool. Maybe there's something with green bodies.
			JoolInSpace = You take a moment to think very, very hard before letting any of the outside environment into this greenhouse.
			LaytheInSpaceLow = The plants begin blossoming sooner than expected. Laythe must be posing some kind of beneficial effect on them even at this height.
			LaytheInSpaceHigh = The plants appear very bright and healthy. It's as though they
			LaytheSrfLanded = You fetch some Laythe soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers and you determine that there is too much moisture and there may be another extreme imbalance of nutrients.
			VallInSpaceLow = Nothing out of the ordinary happens. However, it seems about time to pick some fruits.
			VallInSpaceHigh = The plants show no sign of excitement this time. The situation seems nominal.
			VallSrfLanded = You fetch some Vall soil and apply it to a marked pot. The soil seems to have a strong imbalance of moisture and nutrients but within tolerable limits as the plant does not eventually show signs of death.
			TyloInSpaceLow = The plants gravitate more strongly. It gives you a gentle reminder of how low the vessel is orbiting.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Several plant leaves bend slightly, the typical gravitation matter, but very feintly this time. Well, of course even they acknowledge this dreadful moon's might.
			TyloSrfLanded = You fetch some Tylo soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant starves and withers. This soil must be pretty dry or may contain something unpalatable.
			BopInSpaceLow = Some loose flower petals float about. Some more bounce off of things as you notice them. You could say those bits are Bopping about.
			BopInSpaceHigh = You wonder whether the ship is actually in this moon's sphere of influence as you conduct this experiment... You also wonder if the plants are aware of Bop's influence.
			BopSrfLanded = You fetch some Bop soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant gradually withers but this was expected. Essential microbes are unlikely to be present on this moon at this distance from the star.
			PolInSpaceLow = You notice a bit of yellow color in some of the plants...this warrants close investigation.
			PolInSpaceHigh = The plants seem to be blossoming right now. Did their floweing season come early?
			PolSrfLanded = You fetch some Pol soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant gradually withers but this was expected. Essential microbes are unlikely to be present on a world like this at this distance from anything.
			EelooInSpaceLow = With the vessel oriented towards the star, and no lamps on, you play the longest round of the waiting game to see that... nothing significant happens.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = You turn off the sun lamps that shine on a particular plant or two, partially to save electricity but mainly as an early test of Eeloo's environment.
			EelooSrfLanded = You fetch some Eeloo soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant slowly withers but you saw this a kilometer away. Too much ice and no essential microbes make for an unpleasing test result.

			default = You look out the windows at the sights around you.
			SunInSpaceLow = The light is absolutely blinding, and you can only peer out for brief periods of time before turning away from its power.
			SunInSpaceHigh = Space is so barren out here, with nothing to see for millions and millions of kilometers.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = It's just like a painting. You see vibrant greens, blues, and tans pass you by underneath, and have to gasp at its beauty.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of history seems so small and insignificant from out here. All of it enclosed in a pale blue dot.
			KerbinSrfLanded = Yup, it's a window alright. A really expensive one at that.
			MunInSpaceLow = Solemn greys pass you by, mountains and valleys that seem utterly desolate and foreign.
			MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun and Kerbin seem to rule the skies as equal partners from this point of view.
			MunSrfLanded = You hold up your thumb and blot out Kerbin. You suddenly feel very, very humble.
			MinmusInSpaceLow = Rolling hills and imposing plateaus give way to sheer cliff faces and flats as far as the eye can see. Those flats appear to be very promising landing sites.
			MinmusInSpaceHigh = Minmus is still very small in the night sky, with no real noticeable features yet.
			MinmusSrfLanded = A minty green as far as the eye can see, subliminally making you crave a certain dessert. You brush aside the thoughts, as no treats were to be found here.
			MohoInSpaceLow = This planet seems burnt to its very core, battered by impacts and baked by billions of years close to Kerbol.
			MohoInSpaceHigh = You gaze out at Moho's dark brown surface, wondering how much you've tanned it the time you were in the window.
			MohoSrfLanded = You have to squint to even make out the rocks around you, and the air is very hot in the window.
			EveInSpaceLow = Eve's silver seas and purple soil wait ominously below.
			EveInSpaceHigh = Despite its distance, Eve's size and color commands great respect in the night sky.
			EveSrfLanded = The toxic purple wind whips against the side of the window, slowly eroding the glass. You feel uncomfortable.
			IkeInSpaceLow = Looks just like the Mun to me.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = Whether you got here by accident or on purpose, Ike isn't much of a looker. You divert your eyes back to Duna instead.
			IkeSrfLanded = Upon closer inspection, Ike's dark grey rocks are pretty interesting to look it. You wish you hadn't judged Ike so harshly.
			DunaInSpaceLow = You can make out the traces of ancient red valleys, riverbeds, and lakes. What happened to them?
			DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's bright reds and whites stand out against the sky. It looks more welcoming thean mencacing.
			DunaSrfLanded = While the rusty reds of the soil and sky feel strange and unfamiliar, you could see this as your home in the future.
			DresInSpaceLow = The planet is mostly boring, but the bright grey portions, deep canyon, and pockmarked craters are interesting to see.
			DresInSpaceHigh = What? There's a planet here? I don't see it.
			DresSrfLanded = The topography is more interesting than you thought it would be, but the trip was still too long to be worth it.
			JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's green cloud bands fill up your whole vision, enveloping you in a delicate dance of gases.
			JoolInSpaceHigh = This far away, Jool's interesting system beckons to you. So close, but so far away.
			JoolInSpace = How your window hasn't shattered yet you have no idea.
			LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe's shallow seas, secluded islands, and vibrant blue atmosphere beg to be visited and settled.
			LaytheInSpaceHigh = The small island chains speak of an untouched paradise waiting to be explored.
			LaytheSrfLanded = The shoreline vista soothes you, the sound of lapping waves around you. Far above, a green giant reminds you that these are alien skies.
			VallInSpaceLow = Despite the interesting coloration, Vall doesn't have much to show off. At least, in comparison to Jool itself.
			VallInSpaceHigh = This blue ball looks markedly different from Laythe. You wonder what it would take to transform that ice into seas.
			VallSrfLanded = If you were colorblind, you would have no way of distinguishing Vall from Minmus. You know, except for the massive green ball in the sky.
			TyloInSpaceLow = You feel that coming any closer to this moon would mean your end. You shy away from the window.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo rules the sky as much as Jool from this vantage point. You picture them dueling for supremacy of the moons.
			TyloSrfLanded = Tylo's surface is rocky and dull but still somehow intimidating. You feel stranded.
			BopInSpaceLow = Though Bop itself is unassuming, odd noises in the ship give you the feeling you are unwelcome here.
			BopInSpaceHigh = The moon is a mere brown speck among the grandeur of Jool's other moons.
			BopSrfLanded = Though the surface is barren and desolate, you get chills, as if some powerful force was watching you.
			PolInSpaceLow = Pol's lumpy surface casts deep, long shadows over its many valleys.
			PolInSpaceHigh = Despite being a mere speck, Pol's unique color gives it an air of mystery and importance in the Jool system.
			PolSrfLanded = Interesting, craggy shapes stick out of the surface amid the cavernous valleys and towering hills. This is a place that demands to be explored.
			EelooInSpaceLow = The icy mood of the crew is alleviated by looking at the world below you. You have no desire to land in the yellow snow.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = This far out, the isolation grows to new levels. The dimness of Kerbol doesn't help.
			EelooSrfLanded = Despite the distance, this place seems a little like home, - winter on Kerbin.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceHigh = The plants release water droplets and they float about loosely, or slowly fall away back into their soil. Perhaps they are showing more emotion? Are they crying?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = You fetch some Dres soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers away due to starvation. It's as if the plant did not or could not acknowledge the presence of any soil.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = You fetch some Dres soil and apply it to a marked pot. They show no new characteristcs, meaning Dres must be good for farming on.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceLow = The plants sparkle again. Something about Jool must really appeal to them.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceHigh = The plants gravitate toward Jool. Maybe there's something with green bodies.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = You fetch some Laythe soil and apply it to a marked pot. The plant withers and you determine that there is too much moisture and there may be another extreme imbalance of nutrients.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = You fetch some Laythe soil and apply it to a marked pot. It grows well and even slightly faster and fuller than it did on Kerbin.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceLow = Nothing out of the ordinary happens. However, it seems about time to pick some fruits.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceHigh = The plants show no sign of excitement this time. The situation seems nominal.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallSrfLanded = You fetch some Vall soil and apply it to a marked pot. The soil seems to have a strong imbalance of moisture and nutrients but within tolerable limits as the plant does not eventually show signs of death.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceLow = The plants gravitate more strongly. It gives you a gentle reminder of how low the vessel is orbiting.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceHigh = Several plant leaves bend slightly, the typical gravitation matter, but very feintly this time. Well, of course even they acknowledge this dreadful moon's might.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceHigh = You gaze out at Moho's dark brown surface, wondering how much you've tanned it the time you were in the window.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceLow = The planet is mostly boring, but the bright grey portions, deep canyon, and pockmarked craters are interesting to see.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceHigh = What? There's a planet here? I don't see it.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresSrfLanded = The topography is more interesting than you thought it would be, but the trip was still too long to be worth it.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheSrfLanded = The shoreline vista soothes you, the sound of lapping waves around you. Far above, a green giant reminds you that these are alien skies.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceHigh = This blue ball looks markedly different from Laythe. You wonder what it would take to transform that ice into seas.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallSrfLanded = If you were colorblind, you would have no way of distinguishing Vall from Minmus. You know, except for the massive green ball in the sky.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceLow = You feel that coming any closer to this moon would mean your end. You shy away from the window.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo rules the sky as much as Jool from this vantage point. You picture them dueling for supremacy of the moons.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloSrfLanded = Tylo's surface is rocky and dull but still somehow intimidating. You feel stranded.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceLow = Though Bop itself is unassuming, odd noises in the ship give you the feeling you are unwelcome here.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceHigh = The moon is a mere brown speck among the grandeur of Jool's other moons.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolSrfLanded = Interesting, craggy shapes stick out of the surface amid the cavernous valleys and towering hills. This is a place that demands to be explored.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceLow = The icy mood of the crew is alleviated by looking at the world below you. You have no desire to land in the yellow snow.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceHigh = This far out, the isolation grows to new levels. The dimness of Kerbol doesn't help.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_KerbinSrfLanded = Everything seems to be happily swimming around in its tank.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_MunInSpaceLow = The desolation of the Munar surface doesn't betray even a hint of water. You almost feel like the fish understand this as they stay away from the sides of the tank.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_MunInSpaceHigh = As you hurtle around the planet, you being to reflect on the feasibility of grilling a fish on the tank heat exchanger.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_MunSrfLanded = The low gravity seems to throw the fish off a bit - they bob up and down irregularly. The prawns seem happy though.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_Minmus_InSpaceLow = Fish and minty ice cream go together so well - oh, I'm sorry, I was supposed to be running this spectral analyzer...
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_Minmus_InSpaceHigh = The fish swim in circles around the tank as the pump equipment happily buzzes.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_MinmusSrfLanded = The low gravity doesn't feel like much to the fish or you. You wonder if the KSC has though of putting a fish in a small spacesuit with an EVA jetpack.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_MohoInSpaceLow = The fish swim in circles around the tank as the pump equipment works hard to keep the temperature at equilibrium.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EveInSpaceLow = The purple seas of Eve beckon! You can't wait to test the reaction of the fish to the planet's interestingly coloured water.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EveInSpaceHigh = Hurtling toward the planet at high speed, you measure the tastiness-er, health of the fish.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EveSrfLanded = Holy gadzooks did that solution kill those fish quickly! You guiltily drain the tank that had the Eve water sample in it, faintly conscious of the ticking of the tank radiation counter.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillyInSpaceLow = Your intuition is really telling you that there's no point in scanning the fish now. However, you could try adding something to the water...
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillyInSpaceHigh = Your intuition tells you that the fish won't really be affected by landing on this planet.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillySrfLanded = You hope the crew won't notice the new rocky decorations you've placed inside the tank. They were just floating by out there!

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolInSpaceLow = While observing the planet's colourful storms, you realize the temperature probe has been in the fish tank since the last experiment. You hurriedly remove it.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolInSpaceHigh = The green planet reminds you of the peas from your rehydrated meal packed that you fed to the fish last night.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolSrfLanded = The fish chuckle at your lunacy.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheInSpaceLow = What a beautiful world! You wonder if there are any specimens of aquatic life down there to add to your collection.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheInSpaceHigh = This world looks fish friendly. As you tell the fish this, you sense that they are indifferent.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheSrfLanded = Some fish are missing. It appears one of your crew have taken the liberty of releasing them into the Laythian seas, contaminating them for years to come.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallInSpaceLow = Frigid! You crank the tank heater. The fish look happier.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallInSpaceHigh = Time to whip out your fish bio-spectral analyzer probe! No, stop snickering, that wasn't innuendo.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallSrfLanded = You can't help but wish you'd brought some colder-water fish. The chunk of Vall's icy surface you dissolved in the tank is throwing off the temperature distribution.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloInSpaceLow = The fish look straight back at you, making you want to reconsider your mission choices.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloInSpaceHigh = The pull of Tylo's gravity is similar to Kerbin's, so you'd think the fish would be pleased. Instead, they're not. Oh yeah, you're still in orbit.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloSrfLanded = The fish sulk at the bottom of the tank, looking happy to be back in normal gravity but somehow depressed by the bare landscape outside.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopInSpaceLow = The fish seem disoriented and repeatedly bop into each other.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopInSpaceHigh = The fish are excited at the thought of gravity again, and begin bopping against the top of the tank.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopSrfLanded = Science log, supplemental. These fish look tasty but the captain has locked the access hatch.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_PolInSpaceLow = Some of the fish are a similar colour to the moon out the window. Fancy that!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_PolInSpaceHigh = Biospectral analysis indicates the fish have suffered a lot of bone loss, and look a little droopy. You might not need to debone them at this rate.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooInSpaceLow = Arriving in close orbit around the planet, you observe the aquaponics reservoir. Things seem more or less the same as last time.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooInSpaceHigh = This fish have huddled together for protection from the loneliness of the void. You wish you could get in there too.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooSrfLanded = This far from home, you continue to wonder about how eating a few of the fish would improve rations, and how it would affect the science results.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveSrfLanded = Raccogli un po' di terriccio di Eve in un paio di vasi etichettati. Noti che una appassisce, molto probabilmente per avvelenamento, mentre l'altra, che sembra essere un orchidea, cresce freneticamente e si attorciglia al vaso come un tentacolo del Kraken.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Duna e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante mostrano segni di inedia, forse anche avvelenamento. Determini che il contenuto di metallo è dannatamente troppo alto!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceLow = Le piante non rispondono più. Sono placide e crescono al loro ritmo.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceHigh = Le piante rilasciano goccioline di acqua che fluttuano o ricadono lentamente nel terreno. Forse stanno mostrando emozioni? Stanno piangendo?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Dres e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante appassiscono di inedia. E' come se le piante non possano o non vogliano riconoscere la presenza del terriccio.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Dres e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Non mostrano nessuna caratteristica, significa che Dres deve essere adatto alla coltivazione.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceLow = Le piante luccicano di nuovo. Qualcosa di Jool deve proprio piacergli.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceHigh = Le piante gravitano verso Jool. Forse c'è qualcosa con i corpi verdi.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = Ti prendi un momento per pensare molto, molto seriamente prima di aprire all'ambiente esterno la serra.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = ... Ma dai?!?!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceLow = Le piante germogliano prima del previsto. Laythe deve avere qualche effetto benefico anche a queste altezze.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Le piante sembrano brillanti e in salute.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Laythe e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Avvizziscono e ne deduci che c'è troppa umidità e forse un estremo sbilanciamento dei nutrienti.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Laythe e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Cresce bene e anche un po' più velocemente e pienamente che su Kerbin.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceLow = Non succede niente al di fuori dell'ordinario. Comunque sembra quasi ora di raccogliere un po' di frutta.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceHigh = Le piante non mostrano segni di eccitamento questa volta. La situazione sembra nominale.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Laythe e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Il terriccio sembra avere un eccesso di umidità e uno sbilanciamento dei nutrienti ma nei limiti tollerabili visto che la pianta non mostra segni di morte.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceLow = Le piante gravitano con più forza. E' un cortese richiamo di quanto in basso orbiti.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceHigh = Parecchie foglie si piegano un po', la solita questione gravitazionale, ma molto debole questa volta. Be' di sicuro anche loro riconoscono la potenza di questa tremenda luna.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Tylo e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante sono affamate e appassiscono. Il terriccio deve essere molto asciutto o c'è qualcosa di schifoso.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopInSpaceLow = Qualche petalo fluttua in giro. Qualcun altro rimbalza via. Diresti che è una situazione 'rimbalzosa'.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopInSpaceHigh = Ti domandi se la nave sia effettivamente inella sfera di influenza di questa luna mentre esegui gli esperimenti... Ti domandi anche se le piante sono consapevoli dell'influenza di Bop.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Bop e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante gradualmente avvizziscono ma era prevedibile. E' improbabile trovare i microbi essenziali su questa luna, a questa distanza dalla stella.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolInSpaceLow = Noti qualche puntino giallo su qualche pianta... ci vuole in indagine approfondita.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolInSpaceHigh = Le piante stanno sbocciando proprio ora. La stagione della fioritura è arrivata in inticipo?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di Pol e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante gradualmente avvizziscono ma era prevedibile. E' improbabile trovare i microbi essenziali su questa luna così distante da tutto.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooInSpaceLow = Con la nave orientata verso le stelle, senza lampade, inizi una lunga attesa per vedere che... non succede niente.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooInSpaceHigh = Spegni le lampade solari su un paio di piante, in parte per risparmiare energia ma principalmente per anticipare l'effetto dell'ambiente di Eeloo.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooSrfLanded = Raccogli del terriccio di EEloo e le metti in un vaso etichettato. Le piante lentamente avvizziscono ma questo lo sapevi fin dall'inizio. Troppo ghiaccio e nessun microbo essenziale portano risultati deludenti.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunSrfLanded = Alzi il pollice davanti a Kerbin, coprendolo. Improvvisamente ti senti molto molto umile.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceLow = Dolci colline e imponenti altipiani lasciano il posto a pareti rocciose a strapiombo e pianure a perdita d'occhio. Quei ripiani sembrano un posto promettente per un atterraggio.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceHigh = Minmus è ancora molt opiccolo nel cielo notturno, ancora non se ne distinguono i dettagli.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MinmusSrfLanded = Verde menta fin dove l'occhio spazia, ti vien voglia di un dolce. Spazzi via i tuoi pensieri, non ci sono dolcetti qui da trovare.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceLow = Questo piante sembra bruciato fino al nucleo, battuto dagli impatti e cotto da milioni di anni di vicinanza a Kerbol.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceHigh = Fissi la superficie marrone scuro di Moho, domandandoti quando ti sei abbronzato in questo breve lasso di tempo.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoSrfLanded = Strizzi gli occhi per distinguere le rocce intorno a te, e l'aria è bollente vicino alla finestra.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceLow = I mari argentati e il terreno viola di Eve ti aspettano minacciosi.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceHigh = Nonostante la distanza, la dimensione ed i colori di Eve incutono rispetto.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeInSpaceHigh = Che tu sia qui per sbaglio o di proposito, Ike non è proprio una gioia per gli occhi. Invece ti metti a guardare Duna.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeSrfLanded = Esaminandole da vicino, le rocce grigie di Ike sono decisamente più interessanti. Desideri non ever giudicato Ike così duramente.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceLow = Puoi notare le tracce di antiche vallate rosse, letti di fiumi e laghi. Cosa gli sarà successo?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceHigh = Il bianco e rosso brillante di Duna spiccano contro il cielo. Sono più accoglienti che minacciosi.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaSrfLanded = Anche se il rosso rugginoso del suolo e del cielo sembrano strani e sconosciuti, ti puoi immaginare questo posto come la tua prossima casa.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceLow = Il pianeta è tendenzialmente noioso, ma le parti grigio chiaro, i profondi canaloni e i crateri butterati sono interessanti da vedere.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresSrfLanded = La topografia è più interessante di quanto ti saresti immaginato, ma il viaggio non vale la pena.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceLow = Le bande di nuvole verdi di Jool riempiono completamente la vista, avvolgendoti in una delicata danza dei gas.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceHigh = Anche da così distante, l'interessante sistema di Jool ti richiama. Così vicino, ma ancora così distante.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheSrfLanded = La vista della costa è rilassante, il suono delle onde ti avvolge. In alto, un gigante verde ti ricorda che questi sono cieli alieni.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceHigh = Questa palla blu è visibilmente diversa da Laythe. Ti domandi come si possa trasformare tutto quel ghiaccio in mari.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallSrfLanded = Se fossi daltonico non distingueresti Vall da Minmus. A parte l'enorme palla verde nel cielo.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceLow = Senti che avvicinarti ulteriormente a questa luna sarebbe la tua fine. Ti allontani timidamente dalla finestra.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo domina il cielo almeno quanto Jool da questo punto. Te li immagini duellare per la supremazia delle lune.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloSrfLanded = La superficie di Tylo è scialba e rocciosa eppure in qualche modo intimidante. Ti senti bloccato.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceLow = Anche se l'aspetto di Bop è modesto, strani rumori nella nave ti danno la sensazione di non essere benvenuto qui.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceHigh = La luna è solo un puntino marrone vicino la grandiosità delle altre lune di Jool.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopSrfLanded = Anche se la superficie e desolata e deserta, rabbrividisci, come se un potere superiore ti osservasse.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceLow = La superficie increspata di Pol getta lunghe ombre tra le sue numerose vallate.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceHigh = Malgrado sia appena un granello, il colore univoco di Pol gli da un aria misteriosa e importante nel sistema di Jool.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolSrfLanded = Forme frastagliate ed interessanti emergono dalla superficie tra le vallate cavernose e gli alti picchi. Questo posto desidera essere esplorato.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_KerbinInSpaceHigh = Вы открываете заслонку, чтобы оценить, как это повлияет на растения. Немедленного эффекта не обнаруживается, однако позднее вы замечаете, что одно из растений пожухло и возможно слегка обгорело - то, что было повёрнуто к Солнцу. Это нехороший знак.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EveSrfLanded = Вы добыли немного грунта Евы и насыпали его в два помеченных горшка. Вы замечаете, что одно растения завяло, скорее всего из-за отравления, а другое (кажется, орхидея) - напротив, буйно разрослось и обвилось вокруг горшка как щупальца кракена.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Айке и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растения растут быстрее обычного. Похоже, у Муны появился конкурент.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_IkeSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Айке и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Нового поведения не замечено, похоже грунт - в самый раз.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaInSpaceLow = Вам интересно, что же думают растения о красной планете, учитывая их способность показывать интерес к лунам Кербина.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaInSpaceHigh = Вы наблюдаете слабую, но увеличивающуюся красноту в цветах и плодах.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DunaSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Дюне и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение показывает признаки истощения, возможно даже отравления. Вы заключаете, что содержание металла в грунте слишком-преслишком велико!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceLow = Растения не отвечают. Они спокойны и растут с нормальной скоростью.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresInSpaceHigh = Растения сбрасывают с листьев капельки воды и они летают по всему отсеку, или медленно падают на грунт. Неужели растения показывают эмоции? Они плачут?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Дресе и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение засохло от истощения. Такое впечатление, что растение будто бы вообще не обнаружило никакой почвы.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_DresSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Дресе и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растения не демонстрируют никаких новых свойств, а это значит, что грунт Дреса вполне подходит для выращивания.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceLow = Растения снова поблёскивают. Что-то в Джуле их очень привлекает.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolInSpaceHigh = Растения склоняются в сторону Джула. Возможно, в зелёных небесных телах что-то такое есть.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = Вы улучаете минутку, чтобы очень-очень крепко подумать, прежде чем впустить окружающую среду в эту теплицу.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_JoolSrfLanded = ...Гыгы!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceLow = Растения, похоже, зацвели раньше положенного. Должно быть, Лейт оказывает какое-то благотворное влияние даже на такой высоте.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Растения выглядят живыми и здоровыми. It's as though they
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Лейт и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение засохло. Вы определили, что виной тому избыточная влажность грунта, и возможно, чудовищный дисбаланс минералов.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_LaytheSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на  Лейт и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Образец растёт хорошо, даже развивается чуть быстрее чем на Кербине.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceLow = Ничего экстраординарного не случилось. Впрочем, похоже, уже пора собирать плоды.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallInSpaceHigh = Растения в этот раз не показывают признаков возбуждения. Ситуация в норме.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_VallSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Валл и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. В грунте, похоже, серьёзный дисбаланс влаги и минералов, но в пределах допустимого, поскотку равстение признаков смерти не демонстрирует.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceLow = Растения очень серьёзно наклонились. Это слегка намекает вам о том, насколько низка ваша орбита.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloInSpaceHigh = У некоторых растений слегка изогнулись листья, в гравитационном поле это обычно, но в этот раз выглядит как-то притворно. Разумеется, даже растения уважают мощь этой смертоносной луны.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_TyloSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Тайло и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение истощено и вянет. То ли почва слишком суха, то ли в ней попалось что-то «невкусное».
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopInSpaceLow = Опавшие лепестки кружатся по отсеку, отталкиваясь от стен и предметов. Можно подумать, что они танцуют бип-боп.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopInSpaceHigh = Вы инитересуетесь, находится ли космический аппарат в сфере флияния этой луны, пока вы проводите эксперимент... Также вы интересуетесь, замечают ли растения влияние Бопа.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_BopSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Боп и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение постепенно вянет, но это было ожидаемо. Маловероятно, чтобы в грунте этой луны, на таком расстоянии от Солнца, присутствовали необходимые микрооорганизмы.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolInSpaceLow = Вы замечаете у некоторых растений кусочки жёлтого цвета... эти доказательства позволяют закрыть раслледование.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolInSpaceHigh = Похоже, растения цветут прямо сейчас. Сезон цветения наступил раньше?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_PolSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Пол и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение постепенно вянет, но это было ожидаемо. Маловероятно, чтобы в грунте этой луны, на таком расстоянии от всего, присутствовали необходимые микрооорганизмы.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooInSpaceLow = Сориентировав космический аппарат по звёздам и отключив лампы, вы ждёте, и ждёте, и ждёте... и ничего существенного не происходит.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooInSpaceHigh = Вы выключаете лампы дневного света у пары растений, частично, чтобы сэкономить энергию, но в основном - как ранний тест окружающей среды Илу.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_PlantGrowth_EelooSrfLanded = Вы накопали грунта на Илу и насыпали его в помеченный горшок. Растение постепенно вянет, но вы это знали заранее. Слишком много льда и отсутствие необходимых микроорганизмов обеспечивают отрицательный результат теста.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Title = Визуальное наблюдение
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_default = Вы осматриваете из иллюминатора виды вокруг.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_SunInSpaceLow = Свет абсолютно ослепителен и вы можете лишь украдкой бросать взор, прежде чем отвернуться перед его мощью.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_SunInSpaceHigh = Космос так пуст здесь, на миллионы и миллионы километров вокруг просто не на что смотреть.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinInSpaceLow = Это просто картина. Вы видите как яркое зелёное, синее и желтовато-коричневое проплывает под вами, и задерживаете дыхание, заворожённые этой красотой.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinInSpaceHigh = Вся история кербалчества выглядит столь маленькой и незаметной отсюда. Вся она уместилась в крошечной голубой точке.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_KerbinSrfLanded = Да, это и впрямь иллюминатор. Дорогущщий, надо сказать.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunInSpaceLow = Мрачная серость проплывает под вами, горы и долины, кажущиеся абсолютно пустыми и чуждыми.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunInSpaceHigh = Муна и Кербин царят в небесах как равноправные партнёры с этой точки зрения.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MunSrfLanded = Вы поднимаете палец и закрываете им Кербин. Внезапно вы чувствуете себя очень, очень скромным.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceLow = Крутые холмы и впечатляющие плато уступают место отвесным обрывам и равнинам, простирающимся насколько хватает взгляда. Эти равнины выглядят многообещающими посадочными площадками.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_Minmus_InSpaceHigh = Минмус по прежнему очень мал в ночном небе и отсюда не удаётся рассмотреть никаких подробностей.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MinmusSrfLanded = Мятная зелень повсюду, насколько хватает взгляда. Это подсознательно заставляет вас желать определённый вид десерта. Вы отметаете эти мысли, поскольку вкусняшек поблизости не имеется.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceLow = Планета кажется обгоревшей до самого ядра, избитой метеоритами и запечённой от миллионолетней близости к солнцу.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoInSpaceHigh = Вы глазеете на тёмно-кориченевую поверхность Мохо, раздумывая, насколько вы загорели, пока находились у окна.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_MohoSrfLanded = You have to squint to even make out the rocks around you, and the air is very hot in the window.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceLow = Серебристые моря и пурпурные земли Евы зловеще ожидают вас внизу.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveInSpaceHigh = Несмотря на расстояние, размеры и цвет Евы в ночном небе внушают уважение.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EveSrfLanded = Токсичный пурпурный ветер хлещет по иллюминатору, постепенно разъедая стекло. Вы чувствуете лёгкий дискомфорт.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeInSpaceLow = Выглядит прямо как Муна.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeInSpaceHigh = Попали ли вы сюда случайно или намеренно, Айк - не самое интересное зрелище. Ваши глаза сами поворачиваются обратно в сторону Дюны.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_IkeSrfLanded = При ближайшем рассмотрении, тёмно-серые камни Айка довольно интересно разглядывать. Вы сожалеете о прошлой предубеждённости к Айку.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceLow = Вы замечаете следы древних долин, рек и озёр. Что с ними случилось?
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaInSpaceHigh = Дюна ярким красно-белым пятном выделяется на небосводе. Выглядит скорее приглашающе чем угрожающе.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DunaSrfLanded = Хотя ржавая краснота грунта и неба выглядит странно и непривычно, вы видите Дюну своим возможным будущим домом.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceLow = В целом планета скучная, но ярко-серые части, глубокие каньоны и изрытые отметинами кратеры наблюдать довольно интересно.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresInSpaceHigh = Что? Здесь есть планета?! Не вижу!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_DresSrfLanded = Местная топография гораздо интереснее чем вы думали, но она совершенно не окупает такой длинный путь сюда.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceLow = Зелёные облака Джула заполняют всё поле видимости, захватывая ваше внимание изысканным танцем газов.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolInSpaceHigh = На этом расстоянии интереснейшая система Джула манит вас. Так близко, но всё ещё далеко.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_JoolSrfLanded = Вы не представляете, каким чудом ваш иллюминатор ещё не раскрошился в песок.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheInSpaceLow = Неглубокие моря, уединённые острова и яркая голубая атмосфера Лейт так и просит её посетить или на ней поселиться.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Небольшие цепочки островов говорят о нетронутых райских уголках, ждущих своего исследователя.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_LaytheSrfLanded = Вид на прибрежную линию и звук набегаюющих волн успокаивают вас. Далеко в вышине, зелёный гигант напоминает, что это всё ещё чужое небо.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceLow = Помимо интересной расцветки, Валлу больше нечего показать. ПО крайней мере, в сравнении с сами Джулом.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallInSpaceHigh = Этот голубой шарик разительно отличается от Лейт. Вы раздумываете, во что обойдётся превратить весь этот лёд в моря.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_VallSrfLanded = Будь у вас цветовая слепота, вы с лёгкостью перепутали бы Валл с Минмусом. Ну, знаете, кроме, этого массивного зелёного шарика в небе.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceLow = Вы чувствуете, что подлёт к этой луне станет для вас последним. Вы отворачиваетесь от окна.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloInSpaceHigh = Тайло царствует в небесах наравне с Джулом, в всяком случае с этой наблюдательной позиции. Вы рисуете картину, где они дерутся за обладание лунами.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_TyloSrfLanded = Поверхность Тайло скучна и камениста, но почему-то пугающа. Вы чувствуете себя выброшенным на берег робинзоном.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceLow = Хотя сам Боп неврзрачен, странные звуки в корабле внушают чувство, что вам тут не рады.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopInSpaceHigh = Эта луна - просто коричневое пятнышко среди величия других лун Джула.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_BopSrfLanded = Хотя поверхность пуста и безжизненна, по вам бегают мурашки, как будто некая могущественная сила следит за вами.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceLow = Неровная поверхность Пола отбрасывает глубокие длинные тени на его многочисленные долины.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolInSpaceHigh = Хотя и выглядит пятнышком в иллюминаторе, уникальный цвет Пола придаёт ему налёт мистичности и ощущения его важности в системе Джула.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_PolSrfLanded = Любопытно, острые скальные образования торчат из поверхности посреди пещеристых долин и высоких холмов. Это место просто требует, чтобы его исследовали.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceLow = Равнодушное насроение экипажа скрашивается наблюдением за миром под вами. Главное - не приземлиться в жёлтый снег.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooInSpaceHigh = В такой дали понятие изоляции приобретает новые оттенки. Тусклый свет солнца нисколько не помогает.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_VisualObservation_EelooSrfLanded = Несмотря на расстояние, это место немного похоже на дом - зимний Кербин.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillyInSpaceLow = Интуиция подсказывает вам, что сейчас нет смысла сканировать рыб. Впрочем, можно попробовать добавить кое-что в воду...
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillyInSpaceHigh = Интуиция подсказывает вам, что посадка на эту планету никак не повлияет на рыб.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_GillySrfLanded = Вы надеетесь, что экипаж не заметит новые декоративные камушки, которые вы положили в аквариум. Они же просто пролетали мимо!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_IkeInSpaceLow = Полюбить Айк нетрудно, но рыбы с вами несогласны.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_IkeInSpaceHigh = Здесь можно выращивать рыбу не хуже чем где бы то ни было ещё.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_IkeSrfLanded = Приземлившись на Айк, вы обнаруживаете, что рыбы сгрудились у иллюминатора, наблюдая величественный восход Дюны на горизонте.

			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolInSpaceLow = Наблюдая за разноцветными штормами планеты, вы понимаете, что термометр болтается в аквариуме ещё с прошлого эксперимента. Вы торопливо его вытаскиваете.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolInSpaceHigh = Зелёная планета напоминает вам размоченный сублимированный горох, которым вы кормили рыб вчера вечером.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_JoolSrfLanded = Рыбы смеются над вашими галлюцинациями.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheInSpaceLow = Какой красивый мир! Интересно, есть ли там внизу образцы водной жизни, которые можно добавить в свою коллекцию.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Эта планета выглядит подходящей для рыб. Когда вы сообщаете об этом рыбам, они остаются равнодушными.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_LaytheSrfLanded = Некоторые рыбы пропали из аквариума. Похоже, один из членов экипажа взял на себя право выпустить их в моря Лейт, тем самым заразив их на долгие годы.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallInSpaceLow = Холодно! Вы включаете обогреватель аквариума. Рыбы выглядят чуть довольнее.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallInSpaceHigh = Пришло время выбить дерьмо из вашего биоспектрального анализатора рыбных проб! И прекратите хихикать, я в буквальном смысле!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_VallSrfLanded = Вы искренне жалеете, что не захватили с собой холодолюбивых рыб. Кусок льда Вэл, который вы растопили в аквариуме, серьёзно нарушил температурный баланс.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloInSpaceLow = Рыба таращится прямо на вас, почти что заставляя передумать насчёт выбора миссии.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloInSpaceHigh = Притяжение Тайло здесь примерно такое же как у Кербина, так что вы думаете, рыбам понравится. Впрочем, им не нравится. И да, вы всё ещё на орбите.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_TyloSrfLanded = Рыбы скопились внизу аквариума и выглядят довольными, что вернулись к нормальной нравитации, но в то же время расстроенными из-за пустынного ландшафта в иллюминаторе.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopInSpaceLow = Рыбы выглядят дезориентированными и сталкиваются друг с другом.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopInSpaceHigh = Рыбы места себе не находят при мысли о гравитации, и начинают биться о крышку аквариума.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_BopSrfLanded = Журнал научных наблюдений, запасной: «Рыбы выглядят вкусными. Но капитан запер аквариум на ключ!»
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_PolInSpaceLow = Некоторые из рыб того же цвета, что и луна в иллюминаторе. Стильно!
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_PolInSpaceHigh = Биоспектральный анализ показывает, что рыбы страдают серьёзным дефицитом костной массы, и выглядят понуро. С другой стороны, если так дальше пойдёт - из них их не придётся извлекать кости.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_PolSrfLanded = Вы думаете, что вам понадобятся новые рыбы. Пыль Пола - не самый лучший корм для рыб, к тому же не вполне понятно, безопасно ли есть погибших от неё.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooInSpaceLow = Выйдя на низкую орбиту вокруг планеты, вы осматриваете резервуар аквапоники. Похоже, всё так как и было раньше.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooInSpaceHigh = Рыбы сгрудились в кучу, защищаясь от одиночества открытого космоса. Вам тоже хочется обнимашек.
			#LOC_SSPX_ScienceDef_FishStudy_EelooSrfLanded = Так далеко от дома... Вы раздумываете, насколько поедание нескольких образцов улучшит рацион, и как это повлияет на научные результаты.
